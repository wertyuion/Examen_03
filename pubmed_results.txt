TI  - Tirzepatide Induces a Thermogenic-Like Amino Acid Signature in Brown Adipose
      Tissue.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist,
      delivered superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to selective GLP-1
      receptor (GLP-1R) agonism in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These results
      have fueled mechanistic studies focused on understanding how tirzepatide achieves
      its therapeutic efficacy. Recently, we found that treatment with tirzepatide
      improves insulin sensitivity in humans with T2D and obese mice in concert with a 
      reduction in circulating levels of branched-chain amino (BCAAs) and keto (BCKAs) 
      acids, metabolites associated with development of systemic insulin resistance
      (IR) and T2D. Importantly, these systemic effects were found to be coupled to
      increased expression of BCAA catabolic genes in thermogenic brown adipose tissue 
      (BAT) in mice. These findings led us to hypothesize that tirzepatide may lower
      circulating BCAAs/BCKAs by promoting their catabolism in BAT. METHODS: To address
      this question, we utilized a murine model of diet-induced obesity and employed
      stable-isotope tracer studies in combination with metabolomic analyses in BAT and
      other tissues. RESULTS: Treatment with tirzepatide stimulated catabolism of
      BCAAs/BCKAs in BAT, as demonstrated by increased labeling of BCKA-derived
      metabolites, and increases in levels of byproducts of BCAA breakdown, including
      glutamate, alanine, and 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid (3-HIB). Further, chronic
      administration of tirzepatide increased levels of multiple amino acids in BAT
      that have previously been shown to be elevated in response to cold exposure.
      Finally, chronic treatment with tirzepatide led to a substantial increase in
      several TCA cycle intermediates (alpha-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and malate) in
      BAT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that tirzepatide induces a
      thermogenic-like amino acid profile in BAT, an effect that may account for
      reduced systemic levels of BCAAs in obese IR mice.

TI  - NHC induced radical formation via homolytic cleavage of B-B bonds and its role in
      organic reactions.
PG  - 8321-8333
LID - 10.1039/d2sc02096c [doi]
AB  - New borylation methodologies have been reported recently, wherein diboron(4)
      compounds apparently participate in free radical couplings via the homolytic
      cleavage of the B-B bond. We report herein that bis-NHC adducts of the type
      (NHC)2.B2(OR)4, which are thermally unstable and undergo intramolecular ring
      expansion reactions (RER), are sources of boryl radicals of the type NHC-BR2 ,
      exemplified by Me2Im(Me).Bneop 1a (Me2Im(Me) =
      1,3,4,5-tetramethyl-imidazolin-2-ylidene, neop = neopentylglycolato), which are
      formed by homolytic B-B bond cleavage. Attempts to apply the boryl moiety 1a in a
      metal-free borylation reaction by suppressing the RER failed. However, based on
      these findings, a protocol was developed using Me2Im(Me).B2pin23 for the
      transition metal- and additive-free boryl transfer to substituted aryl iodides
      and bromides giving aryl boronate esters in good yields. Analysis of the side
      products and further studies concerning the reaction mechanism revealed that
      radicals are likely involved. An aryl radical was trapped by TEMPO, an EPR
      resonance, which was suggestive of a boron-based radical, was detected in situ,
      and running the reaction in styrene led to the formation of polystyrene. The
      isolation of a boronium cation side product, [(Me2Im(Me))2.Bpin](+)I(-)7,
      demonstrated the fate of the second boryl moiety of B2pin2. Interestingly,
      Me2Im(Me) NHC reacts with aryl iodides and bromides generating radicals. A
      mechanism for the boryl radical transfer from Me2Im(Me).B2pin23 to aryl iodides
      and bromides is proposed based on these experimental observations.

TI  - Role of Distinct Fat Depots in Metabolic Regulation and Pathological
      Implications.
LID - 10.1007/112_2022_73 [doi]
AB  - People suffering from obesity and associated metabolic disorders including
      diabetes are increasing exponentially around the world. Adipose tissue (AT)
      distribution and alteration in their biochemical properties play a major role in 
      the pathogenesis of these diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that AT
      heterogeneity and depot-specific physiological changes are vital in the
      development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues like muscle and liver.
      Classically, AT depots are classified into white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown
      adipose tissue (BAT); WAT is the site of fatty acid storage, while BAT is a
      dedicated organ of metabolic heat production. The discovery of beige adipocyte
      clusters in WAT depots indicates AT heterogeneity has a more central role than
      hither to ascribed. Therefore, we have discussed in detail the current state of
      understanding on cellular and molecular origin of different AT depots and their
      relevance toward physiological metabolic homeostasis. A major focus is to
      highlight the correlation between altered WAT distribution in the body and
      metabolic pathogenesis in animal models and humans. We have also underscored the 
      disparity in the molecular (including signaling) changes in various WAT tissues
      during diabetic pathogenesis. Exercise-mediated beneficial alteration in WAT
      physiology/distribution that protects against metabolic disorders is evolving.
      Here we have discussed the depot-specific biochemical adjustments induced by
      different forms of exercise. A detailed understanding of the molecular details of
      inter-organ crosstalk via substrate utilization/storage and signaling through
      chemokines provide strategies to target selected WAT depots to pharmacologically 
      mimic the benefits of exercise countering metabolic diseases including diabetes.

TI  - One session treatment (OST) is equivalent to multi-session cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) in children with specific phobias (ASPECT): results from a national
      non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.13665 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 5%-10% children and young people (CYP) experience specific phobias
      that impact daily functioning. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is recommended
      but has limitations. One Session Treatment (OST), a briefer alternative
      incorporating CBT principles, has demonstrated efficacy. The Alleviating Specific
      Phobias Experienced by Children Trial (ASPECT) investigated the non-inferiority
      of OST compared to multi-session CBT for treating specific phobias in CYP.
      METHODS: ASPECT was a pragmatic, multi-center, non-inferiority randomized
      controlled trial in 26 CAMHS sites, three voluntary agency services, and one
      university-based CYP well-being service. CYP aged 7-16 years with specific phobia
      were randomized to receive OST or CBT. Clinical non-inferiority and a nested
      cost-effectiveness evaluation was assessed 6-months post-randomization using the 
      Behavioural Avoidance Task (BAT). Secondary outcome measures included the Anxiety
      Disorder Interview Schedule, Child Anxiety Impact Scale, Revised Children's
      Anxiety Depression Scale, goal-based outcome measure, and EQ-5DY and CHU-9D,
      collected blind at baseline and six-months. RESULTS: 268 CYPs were randomized to 
      OST (n = 134) or CBT (n = 134). Mean BAT scores at 6 months were similar across
      groups in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations (CBT:
      7.1 (ITT, n = 76), 7.4 (PP, n = 57), OST: 7.4 (ITT, n = 73), 7.6 (PP, n = 56), on
      the standardized scale-adjusted mean difference for CBT compared to OST -0.123,
      95% CI -0.449 to 0.202 (ITT), mean difference -0.204, 95% CI -0.579 to 0.171
      (PP)). These findings were wholly below the standardized non-inferiority limit of
      0.4, suggesting that OST is non-inferior to CBT. No between-group differences
      were found on secondary outcomes. OST marginally decreased mean service use costs
      and maintained similar mean Quality Adjusted Life Years compared to CBT.
      CONCLUSIONS: One Session Treatment has similar clinical effectiveness to CBT for 
      specific phobias in CYP and may be a cost-saving alternative.

AB  - No cigarette smoke test matrix is without limitation, due to the complexity of
      the starting aerosol and phase to phase dynamics. It is impossible to capture all
      chemicals at the same level of efficiency, therefore, any test matrix will
      inadvertently or by design fractionate the test aerosol. This case study examines
      how four different test matrices derived from cigarette smoke can be directly
      compared. The test matrices assessed were as follows, total particulate matter
      (TPM), gas vapour phase (GVP), a combination of TPM + GVP and whole aerosol (WA).
      Here we use an example assay, the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) to demonstrate that 
      data generated across four cigarette smoke test matrices can be compared. The
      results show that all test matrices were able to induce positive mutational
      events, but with clear differences in the biological activity (both potency and
      toxicity) between them. TPM was deemed the most potent test article and by
      extension, the particulate phase is interpreted as the main driver of genotoxic
      induced responses in the MLA. However, the results highlight that the vapour
      phase is also active. MLA appeared responsive to WA, with potentially lower
      potency, compared to TPM approaches. However, this observation is caveated in
      that the WA approaches used for comparison were made on a newly developed
      experimental method using dose calculations. The TPM + GVP matrix had comparable 
      activity to TPM alone, but interestingly induced a greater number of mutational
      events at comparable relative total growth (RTG) and TPM-equivalent doses when
      compared to other test matrices. In conclusion, this case study highlights the
      importance of understanding test matrices in response to the biological assay
      being assessed and we note that not all test matrices are equal.

AB  - The Amino Acid-Polyamine-Organocation (APC) family transporters containing
      BAT/ACT (amino acid/choline transporters), PHS/LAT (polyamine H+-symporters) and 
      CAT (cationic amino acid transporters) type transporters are ubiquitously
      reported in plants. ACT (containing BAT genes) which mediates bidirectional amino
      acid transport has been poorly characterized till date. In the present study,
      bioinformatics-based analytical studies have been performed to characterize the
      structural, functional, and evolutionary features of seven ACT/BAT transporters
      in the model crop Oryza sativa. Sequence homologies with allied transporters
      suggest that these seven transporter proteins can also have important roles in
      regulating amino acid transportation. Evolutionary and phylogenetic study of
      OsBATs proteins using different statistical models based on CDS, Protein, and UTR
      regions have brought forward some valuable information regarding their way and
      patterns of diversification over the time, possibly due to the influence of their
      prevailing growth conditions. Computational analyses based on promoter regions,
      exon-intron structural patterns, conserved motifs, secondary and tertiary
      structures and ligand binding sites with probable ligand names provided clues on 
      their evolutionary structural diversification indicating changes in their
      functional specification probably needed to combat with the changing environment.

TI  - Establishing diagnostic strategies for cannabis allergy.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/1744666X.2022.2108791 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit drug in the world and 
      carries a risk of severe IgE-mediated allergic reactions, requiring appropriate
      diagnostic management. Currently available diagnostics are still relatively
      limited and require careful interpretation of results to avoid harmful over- and 
      underdiagnosis. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the most up-to-date
      understandings of cannabis allergy diagnosis, starting with the main clinical
      features of the disease and the allergenic characteristics of Cannabis sativa,
      and then providing insights into in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo diagnostic tests.
      EXPERT OPINION: At present, the diagnosis of IgE-mediated cannabis allergy is
      based on a three-step approach that starts with accurate history taking and ends 
      with a confirmation of sensitization to the whole extract and, finally, molecular
      components. Although much has been discovered since its first description in
      1971, the diagnosis of cannabis allergy still has many unmet needs. The lack of
      commercial standardized and validated extracts and in vitro assays makes a
      harmonized workup of cannabis allergy difficult. Furthermore, the epidemiological
      characteristics, and clinical implications of sensitization to different
      molecular components are not yet fully known. Future research will complete the
      picture and likely result in an individualized and standardized approach.

TI  - Xenon-enhanced computed tomography assessment of brown adipose tissue
      distribution and perfusion in lean, obese, and diabetic primates.
LID - 10.1002/oby.23519 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate xenon-enhanced computed tomography (XECT)
      for the detection of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and to use XECT to assess
      differences in BAT distribution and perfusion between lean, obese, and diabetic
      nonhuman primates (NHPs). METHODS: Whole-body XECT imaging was performed in
      anesthetized rhesus and vervet monkeys during adrenergic stimulation of BAT
      thermogenesis. In XECT images, BAT was identified as fat tissue that, during
      xenon inhalation, underwent significant radiodensity enhancement compared with
      subcutaneous fat. To measure BAT blood flow, BAT radiodensity enhancement was
      measured over time on the six computed tomography scans acquired during xenon
      inhalation. Postmortem immunohistochemical staining was used to confirm imaging
      findings. RESULTS: XECT was able to correctly identify all BAT depots that were
      confirmed at necropsy, enabling construction of the first comprehensive
      anatomical map of BAT in NHPs. A significant decrease in BAT perfusion was found 
      in diabetic animals compared with obese animals and healthy animals, as well as
      absence of axillary BAT and significant reduction of supraclavicular BAT in
      diabetic animals compared with obese and lean animals. CONCLUSIONS: The use of
      XECT in NHP models of obesity and diabetes allows the analysis of the impact of
      metabolic status on BAT mass and perfusion.

TI  - Violence and unsafety in Italian hospitals: Experience and perceptions of nursing
      students.
LID - 10.3233/WOR-210488 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of workplace violence towards healthcare workers
      represents a challenge for healthcare organizations worldwide. Workers'
      experience and perceived risk of violence may have a serious impact on job
      satisfaction and retention of workers. To date, no studies have been conducted on
      nursing students. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of physical and
      non-physical violence among nursing students during their clinical experiences
      and to analyze the perceived risk of violence. METHODS: Multicentre,
      cross-sectional survey. We enrolled a convenience sample of nursing students of
      the bachelor's degree in Nursing of the University of Milan (Italy). The students
      completed a structured questionnaire prepared in accordance with the available
      literature on violence in healthcare settings. RESULTS: Out of 1185
      questionnaires sent, 603 were collected (50.89%). 35.1% had experience of verbal 
      violence during the clinical internship training period, while 8.1% were victims 
      of physical violence. 202 students (33.5%) reported unsafety, which was related
      to experience of physical or psychological violence, witnessed episodes of
      violence, gender, hospital structure and efficacy of the safety policies.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that nursing students are exposed to the risk
      of violence which influences their perception of risk.

TI  - Mid-Atlantic Big Brown and Eastern Red Bats: Relationships between Acoustic
      Activity and Reproductive Phenology.
PG  - 319
LID - 10.3390/d14050319 [doi]
AB  - Acoustic data are often used to describe bat activity, including habitat use
      within the summer reproductive period. These data inform management activities
      that potentially impact bats, currently a taxa of high conservation concern. To
      understand the relationship between acoustic and reproductive timing, we sampled 
      big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) on 482
      mist-netting and 35,410 passive acoustic sampling nights within the District of
      Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, 2015-2018. We
      documented the proportion of female, pregnant, lactating, and juvenile big brown 
      and eastern red bats within each mist-net sampling event and calculated locally
      estimated non-parametric scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) lines for each
      reproductive and acoustic dataset. We compared the peak in acoustic activity with
      the peaks of each reproductive condition. We determined that the highest levels
      of acoustic activity within the maternity season were most associated with the
      period wherein we captured the highest proportions of lactating bats, not
      juvenile bats, as often assumed.

TI  - Are Grid-Like Representations a Component of All Perception and Cognition?
PG  - 924016
LID - 10.3389/fncir.2022.924016 [doi]
AB  - Grid cells or grid-like responses have been reported in the rodent, bat and human
      brains during various spatial and non-spatial tasks. However, the functions of
      grid-like representations beyond the classical hippocampal formation remain
      elusive. Based on accumulating evidence from recent rodent recordings and human
      fMRI data, we make speculative accounts regarding the mechanisms and functional
      significance of the sensory cortical grid cells and further make theory-driven
      predictions. We argue and reason the rationale why grid responses may be
      universal in the brain for a wide range of perceptual and cognitive tasks that
      involve locomotion and mental navigation. Computational modeling may provide an
      alternative and complementary means to investigate the grid code or grid-like
      map. We hope that the new discussion will lead to experimentally testable
      hypotheses and drive future experimental data collection.

TI  - Basophil Activation Test as a Biomarker for Taxanes Anaphylaxis.
PG  - 787749
LID - 10.3389/falgy.2022.787749 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Taxanes are widely used chemotherapy agents, and their
      administration, despite premedication, is associated with hypersensitivity
      reactions (HR) in up to 9% of patients, 1% of which are severe. The mechanisms of
      these reactions are not fully understood. Finding biomarkers for early diagnosis 
      and better understanding the underlying mechanisms of these reactions are key to 
      defining the best treatment strategy for patients. Methods: The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the basophil activation test (BAT) to 
      diagnose patients with anaphylactic reactions to taxanes. Patients with
      anaphylaxis to taxane compounds (n = 15) were assessed through clinical history, 
      skin testing (when possible), and BAT. BAT was performed immediately before rapid
      drug desensitization or before skin testing using anti-CD123 conjugated
      (APC-Biolegend), anti-HLADR conjugated (FITC-Biolegend) to gate Basophils and
      anti-CD63 conjugated (PE-Biolegend), and anti-CD203c conjugated (BV-Biolegend) to
      assess CD203c and CD63 expression on basophils under taxane stimulation. BAT was 
      also performed in eight healthy volunteers. Results: BAT was positive for CD203c 
      in eight out of 15 patients and for CD63 in four out of 15 patients and in two
      out of eight controls. The sensitivity for CD203c was 53%, the specificity was
      87%, and the area under the curve was 0.66 (p = 0.19%). For CD63, these rates
      were 33%, 87%, and 0.6 (p = 0.4). In a subgroup analysis of patients with
      positive skin tests (11 patients), CD203c was positive in six patients
      (sensitivity of 54.5% and specificity of 87.5%), and CD63 was positive in five
      patients (sensitivity of 45% and specificity of 75%). Conclusions: BAT as a
      diagnostic tool for immediate hypersensitivity reactions to taxanes may be
      relevant in patients with selected phenotypes and endotypes, especially those
      with severe reactions or when the diagnosis cannot be established by the skin
      test. Increased expression of CD203c was more frequent than of CD63 in patients
      with positive results, and the sensitivity of this biomarker was higher in
      patient sub-group with positive skin tests, i.e., patients with IgE-mediated
      endotypes.

AB  - The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is an adipose tissue depot which surrounds
      most human blood vessels. It is metabolically active and has both a protective
      and a pathogenic role in vascular biology and pathobiology. It regulates vascular
      homeostasis and promotes vascular dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to
      consider the origin, structure, function, and dysfunction of this unique adipose 
      depot consisting of white (WAT), brown (BAT) and beige adipose tissue, to support
      the concept that PVAT may be considered the fourth layer of the normal arterial
      wall (tunica adiposa), in which dysfunction creates a microenvironment that
      regulates, in part, the initiation and growth of the fibro-inflammatory lipid
      atherosclerotic plaque. Experimental in-vivo and in-vitro studies and human
      investigations show that the adipocytes, extracellular matrix, nerve fibers and
      vasa vasorum found in PVAT form a functional adipose tissue unit adjacent to, but
      not anatomically separated from, the adventitia. PVAT maintains and regulates the
      structure and function of the normal arterial wall through autocrine and
      paracrine mechanisms, that include modulation of medial smooth muscle cell
      contractility and secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules. PVAT shows regional
      phenotypic heterogeneity which may be important in its effect on the wall of
      specific sections of the aorta and its muscular branches during perturbations and
      various injuries including obesity and diabetes. In atherosclerosis, a
      pan-vascular microenvironment is created that functionally links the
      intima-medial atherosclerotic plaque to the adventitia and PVAT beneath the
      plaque, highlighting the local impact of PVAT on atherogenesis. PVAT adipocytes
      have inflammatory effects which in response to injury show activation and
      phenotypic changes, some of which are considered to have direct and indirect
      effects on the intima and media during the initiation, growth, and development of
      complicated atherosclerotic plaques. Thus, it is important to maintain the
      integrity of the full vascular microenvironment so that design of experimental
      and human studies include investigation of PVAT. The era of discarding PVAT
      tissue in both experimental and human research and clinical vascular studies
      should end.

TI  - Toward in vivo proof of binding of (18)F-labeled inhibitor [(18)F]TRACK to
      peripheral tropomyosin receptor kinases.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s13550-022-00915-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tropomyosin receptor kinases (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC) are a family of
      tyrosine kinases primarily expressed in neuronal cells of the brain.
      Identification of oncogenic alterations in Trk expression as a driver in multiple
      tumor types has increased interest in their role in human cancers. Recently,
      first- and second-generation (11)C and (18)F-labeled Trk inhibitors, e.g.,
      [(18)F]TRACK, have been developed. The goal of the present study was to analyze
      the direct interaction of [(18)F]TRACK with peripheral Trk receptors in vivo to
      prove its specificity for use as a functional imaging probe. METHODS: In vitro
      uptake and competition experiments were carried out using the colorectal cancer
      cell line KM12. Dynamic PET experiments were performed with [(18)F]TRACK, either 
      alone or in the presence of amitriptyline, an activator of Trk, entrectinib, a
      Trk inhibitor, or unlabeled reference compound TRACK in KM12 tumor-bearing
      athymic nude mice as well as B6129SF2/J and corresponding
      B6;129S2-Ntrk2(tm1Bbd)/J mice. Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments 
      were done with KM12 tumors, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and brain tissue samples.
      RESULTS: Uptake of [(18)F]TRACK was increasing over time reaching 208 +/- 72%
      radioactivity per mg protein (n = 6/2) after 60 min incubation time. Entrectinib 
      and TRACK competitively blocked [(18)F]TRACK uptake in vitro (IC50 30.9 +/- 3.6
      and 29.4 +/- 9.4 nM; both n = 6/2). [(18)F]TRACK showed uptake into KM12 tumors
      (SUVmean,60 min 0.43 +/- 0.03; n = 6). Tumor-to-muscle ratio reached 0.9 (60 min)
      and 1.2 (120 min). In TrkB expressing BAT, [(18)F]TRACK uptake reached SUVmean,60
      min 1.32 +/- 0.08 (n = 7). Activation of Trk through amitriptyline resulted in a 
      significant radioactivity increase of 21% in KM12 tumor (SUVmean,60 min from 0.53
      +/- 0.01 to 0.43 +/- 0.03; n = 6; p < 0.05) and of 21% in BAT (SUVmean,60 min
      from 1.32 +/- 0.08; n = 5 to 1.59 +/- 0.07; n = 6; p < 0.05) respectively.
      Immunohistochemistry showed TrkB > TrkA expression on BAT fat cells, but TrkA >
      TrkB in whole brain. WB analysis showed sevenfold higher TrkB expression in BAT
      versus KM12 tumor tissue. CONCLUSION: The present data show that radiotracer
      [(18)F]TRACK can target peripheral Trk receptors in human KM12 colon cancer as
      well as brown adipose tissue as confirmed through in vitro and in vivo blocking
      experiments. Higher TrkB versus TrkA protein expression was detected in brown
      adipose tissue of mice confirming a peripheral functional role of brain-derived

      of three bioenergy crops.

AB  - The effects of organic amendments on the phytoremediation of cadmium (Cd) in
      acacia (Acacia mangium), jatropha (Jatropha curcas), and cassava (Manihot
      esculenta) were investigated. The bone meal/bat manure and leonardite/bat manure 
      amendments resulted in better growth performance in both acacia and cassava
      (growth rate in dry biomass; GRDB 24.2 and 22.2, respectively), while bone meal
      (GRDB 17.2) was best for jatropha. The lower root/shoot ratio values of jatropha 
      and acacia suggest that these species were better suited than cassava on
      Cd-contaminated soil. Cassava experienced toxicity symptoms after harvest (3
      months). Acacia root accumulated somewhat greater Cd concentrations (up to 5.1 mg
      kg(-1)) than cassava and jatropha roots (2.2-3.9 and 2.7-4.1 mg kg(-1),
      respectively). The bone meal and chicken manure (BMCM) treatment for jatropha had
      the highest bioconcentration factor for root (1.3) and the lowest translocation
      factor (0.7). Despite the fact that this treatment had substantial Cd
      concentrations in the soil (3.1 mg kg(-1)), low Cd accumulation value (3.2 mg
      kg(-1)) and the lowest Cd uptake value (127.8 mg plant(-1)) were observed,
      clearly indicating that this amendment reduced Cd bioavailability. When growth
      performance of the study plants is considered, jatropha and acacia may be
      suitable for phytomanagement of Cd-contaminated soil.

TI  - Reducing Phlebotomy, Length of Stay, Cost: Development of a Blunt Abdominal
      Trauma Pathway in a Level I, Pediatric Trauma Center.
LID - 10.1097/PEC.0000000000002613 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is a leading cause of morbidity in
      children with higher hemodynamic stabilities when compared with adults. Pediatric
      patients with BAT can often be managed without surgical interventions; however,
      laboratory testing is often recommended. Yet, laboratory testing can be costly,
      and current literature has not identified appropriate pathways or specific tests 
      necessary to detect intra-abdominal injury after BAT. Therefore, the present
      study evaluated a proposed laboratory testing pathway to determine if it safely
      reduced draws of complete blood counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis,
      comprehensive metabolic panels, amylase and lipase levels orders, emergency
      department (ED) length of stay, and cost in pediatric BAT patients. Methods: A
      retrospective review of levels I, II, and III BAT pediatric patients (n = 329)
      was performed from 2015 to 2018 at our level I, pediatric trauma center. Patients
      were then grouped based on pre-post pathway, and differences were calculated
      using univariate analyses. Results: After implementation of the pathway, there
      was a significant decrease in the number of complete blood counts, coagulation
      studies, urinalysis, comprehensive metabolic panels, amylase, and lipase levels
      orders (P < 0.05). Postpathway patients had lower average ED lengths of stay and 
      testing costs compared with the pre pathway patients (P < 0.05). There was no
      increase in rates of return to the ED within 30 days, missed injuries, or
      readmissions of patients to the ED. Conclusions: Results displayed that the
      adoption of a laboratory testing pathway for BAT patients reduced the number of
      laboratory tests, ED length of stay, and associated costs pediatric patients
      without impacting quality care.

      Immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Detection.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic. To date,
      504,907,616 people have been infected and developed coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19). A rapid and simple diagnostic method is needed to control this
      pandemic. In this study, a visual nucleic acid detection method combining reverse
      transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and a vertical flow
      visualization strip (RT-LAMP-VF) was successfully established and could detect 20
      copies/mul of SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcript within 50 min at 61 degrees C. This assay
      had no cross-reactivity with a variety of coronaviruses, including human
      coronavirus OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
      coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),
      and bat coronavirus HKU4, exhibiting very high levels of diagnostic sensitivity
      and specificity. Most strikingly, this method can be used for detecting multiple 
      SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, Delta, and Omicron
      variants. Compared with the RT-qPCR method recommended by the World Health
      Organization (WHO), RT-LAMP-VF does not require special equipment and is easy to 
      perform. As a result, it is more suitable for rapid screening of suspected
      SARS-CoV-2 samples in the field and local laboratories.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emphasized the serious threat to human health
      posed by emerging coronaviruses. Effective broadly-acting antiviral
      countermeasures are urgently needed to prepare for future emerging CoVs, as
      vaccine development is not compatible with a rapid response to a newly emerging
      virus. The green tea catechin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has
      broad-spectrum antiviral activity, although its mechanisms against coronavirus
      (CoV) infection have remained unclear. Here, we show that EGCG prevents human and
      murine CoV infection and blocks the entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped
      with spike proteins from bat or highly pathogenic CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2
      variants of concern, in lung epithelial cells. Mechanistically, EGCG treatment
      reduces CoV attachment to target cell surfaces by interfering with attachment to 
      cell-surface glycans. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are a required attachment
      factor for SARS-CoV-2 and are shown here to be important in endemic HCoV-OC43
      infection. We show that EGCG can compete with heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, 
      for virion binding. Our results highlight heparan sulfate as a conserved cell
      attachment factor for CoVs, and demonstrate the potential for the development of 
      pan-coronavirus attachment inhibitors, which may be useful to protect against
      future emerging CoVs.

TI  - Avian adjustments to cold and non-shivering thermogenesis: whats, wheres and
      hows.
LID - 10.1111/brv.12885 [doi]
AB  - Avian cold adaptation is hallmarked by innovative strategies of both heat
      conservation and thermogenesis. While minimizing heat loss can reduce the
      thermogenic demands of body temperature maintenance, it cannot eliminate the
      requirement for thermogenesis. Shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST)
      are the two synergistic mechanisms contributing to endothermy. Birds are of
      particular interest in studies of NST as they lack brown adipose tissue (BAT),
      the major organ of NST in mammals. Critical analysis of the existing literature
      on avian strategies of cold adaptation suggests that skeletal muscle is the
      principal site of NST. Despite recent progress, isolating the mechanisms involved
      in avian muscle NST has been difficult as shivering and NST co-exist with its
      primary locomotory function. Herein, we re-evaluate various proposed molecular
      bases of avian skeletal muscle NST. Experimental evidence suggests that
      sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) -ATPase (SERCA) and ryanodine receptor 1
      (RyR1) are key in avian muscle NST, through their mediation of futile Ca(2+)
      cycling and thermogenesis. More recent studies have shown that SERCA regulation
      by sarcolipin (SLN) facilitates muscle NST in mammals; however, its role in birds
      is unclear. Ca(2+) signalling in the muscle seems to be common to contraction,
      shivering and NST, but elucidating its roles will require more precise
      measurement of local Ca(2+) levels inside avian myofibres. The endocrine control 
      of avian muscle NST is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the
      mechanistic details of avian muscle NST will provide insights into the roles of
      these processes in regulatory thermogenesis, which could further inform our
      understanding of the evolution of endothermy among vertebrates.

TI  - Multifaceted DNA metabarcoding of guano to uncover multiple classes of ecological
      data in two different bat communities.
PG  - 1189-1200

AB  - DNA contained in animal scat provides a wealth of information about the animal,
      and DNA metabarcoding of scat collections can provide key information about
      animal populations and communities. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies
      and DNA metabarcoding provide an efficient means for obtaining information
      available in scat samples. We used multifaceted DNA metabarcoding (MDM) of
      noninvasively collected bat guano pellets from a Myotis lucifugus colony on Fort 
      Drum Military Installation, New York, USA, and from two mixed-species bat roosts 
      on Fort Huachuca Military Installation, Arizona, USA, to identify attributes such
      as bat species composition, sex ratios, diet, and the presence of pathogens and
      parasites. We successfully identified bat species for nearly 98% of samples from 
      Fort Drum and 90% of samples from Fort Huachuca, and identified the sex for 84%
      and 67% of samples from these same locations, respectively. Species and sex
      identification matched expectations based on prior censuses of bat populations
      utilizing those roosts, though samples from some species were more or less common
      than anticipated within Fort Huachuca roosts. Nearly 62% of guano samples from
      Fort Drum contained DNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans, where bats with wing
      damage from White-nose Syndrome were commonly observed. Putative dietary items
      were detected in a majority of samples from insectivorous bats on Fort Drum (81%)
      and Fort Huachuca (63%). A minority of guano samples identified as the
      nectarivorous Leptonycteris yerbabuenae (28%) provided DNA sequences from
      putative forage plant species. Finally, DNA sequences from both putative ecto-
      and endoparasite taxa were detected in 35% and 56% of samples from Fort Drum and 
      Fort Huachuca, respectively. This study demonstrates that the combination of
      noninvasive sampling, DNA metabarcoding, and sample and locus multiplexing
      provide a wide array of data that are otherwise difficult to obtain.

TI  - Sexual Dimorphism in Brown Adipose Tissue Activation and White Adipose Tissue
      Browning.
LID - 8250 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158250 [doi]
AB  - The present narrative review gathers the studies reported so far, addressing sex 
      differences in the effects of cold exposure, feeding pattern and age on brown
      adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and white adipose tissue (WAT) browning. In
      rodents, when exposed to decreasing temperatures, females activate thermogenesis 
      earlier. Results obtained in humans go in the same line, although they do not
      provide results as solid as those obtained in rodents. Regarding the effects of
      overfeeding, interesting sex differences on BAT thermogenic capacity have been
      reported, and the greater or lower sensitivity of each sex to this dietary
      situation seems to be dependent on the type of feeding. In the case of energy
      restriction, females are more sensitive than males. In addition, sex differences 
      have also been observed in thermogenesis changes induced by phenolic compound
      administration. During sexual development, an increase in BAT mass and BAT
      activity takes place. This phenomenon is greater in boys than in girls, probably 
      due to its relation to muscle-mass growth. The opposite situation takes place
      during ageing, a lifespan period where thermogenic capacity declines, this being 
      more acute in men than in women. Finally, the vast majority of the studies have
      reported a higher susceptibility to developing WAT browning amongst females. The 
      scarcity of results highlights the need for further studies devoted to analysing 
      this issue, in order to provide valuable information for a more personalised
      approach.

      domains.

AB  - Viral spillover from animal reservoirs can trigger public health crises and
      cripple the world economy. Knowing which viruses are primed for zoonotic
      transmission can focus surveillance efforts and mitigation strategies for future 
      pandemics. Successful engagement of receptor protein orthologs is necessary
      during cross-species transmission. The clade 1 sarbecoviruses including Severe
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 enter
      cells via engagement of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), while the
      receptor for clade 2 and clade 3 remains largely uncharacterized. We developed a 
      mixed cell pseudotyped virus infection assay to determine whether various clades 
      2 and 3 sarbecovirus spike proteins can enter HEK 293T cells expressing human or 
      Rhinolophus horseshoe bat ACE2 proteins. The receptor binding domains from BtKY72
      and Khosta-2 used human ACE2 for entry, while BtKY72 and Khosta-1 exhibited
      widespread use of diverse rhinolophid ACE2s. A lysine at ACE2 position 31
      appeared to be a major determinant of the inability of these RBDs to use a
      certain ACE2 sequence. The ACE2 protein from Rhinolophus alcyone engaged all
      known clade 3 and clade 1 receptor binding domains. We observed little use of
      Rhinolophus ACE2 orthologs by the clade 2 viruses, supporting the likely use of a
      separate, unknown receptor. Our results suggest that clade 3 sarbecoviruses from 
      Africa and Europe use Rhinolophus ACE2 for entry, and their spike proteins appear
      primed to contribute to zoonosis under the right conditions.

TI  - Warming Up With a Dynamic Moment of Inertia Bat Can Increase Bat Swing Speed in
      Competitive Baseball Players.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2021-0351 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: While most baseball players' warm-up with a weighted bat/donut,
      there is evidence to suggest the swing speed decreases after the warm-up even
      though the bat feels lighter. Warming up with a dynamic moment of inertia bat may
      not decrease the swing speed and therefore improve the performance of baseball
      players. The hypothesis is that a dynamic moment of inertia bat will negate the
      effect of the kinesthetic illusion observed with a weighted bat. OBJECTIVE: To
      measure the difference in bat swing speed between warming up with the dynamic
      moment of inertia bat compared with a weighted bat. METHODS: Thirty-nine
      competitive baseball players participated in the study. All players were randomly
      assigned a warm-up tool that could be either a dynamic moment of inertia bat or a
      weighted bat. After the players' warm-up, they swung their normal bat, and the
      bat swing speed was measured using a high-speed camera. We used motion analysis
      software to calculate the swing speed which measured the linear displacement
      during the last 15 frames before ball contact. The process was then repeated so
      that each player had the chance to try both warm-up bats. RESULTS: The post
      warm-up swing speeds using the dynamic moment of inertia bat were significantly
      faster compared with a weighted bat warm-up. There was a 0.56 (0.78) m/s (1.26
      [1.74] mph) increase in swing speed when using the dynamic moment of inertia bat 
      (P = .0001), which is an average increase of 2.10% compared with a weighted bat
      warm-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that using a dynamic moment of inertia
      bat before an at-bat can increase swing speed compared with a weighted warm-up.
      Future studies are needed to determine if using a dynamic moment of inertia bat
      as part of rehabilitation can facilitate returning to competition after injury by
      focusing on swing speed.

TI  - Brown adipose tissue influences adiponectin and thyroid hormone changes during
      Graves' disease therapy.
PG  - 389-400
LID - 10.1080/21623945.2022.2104509 [doi]
AB  - Thyroid hormones (TH), adiponectin and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are regulators 
      of energy homoeostasis. Influence of BAT activity on the relationship between TH 
      and adiponectin remains unexplored. The aim of the study was to identify the
      relationship between TH and adiponectin and to clarify the impact of active BAT
      on the metabolic effects of adiponectin before and after the correction of
      thyrotoxicosis. Twenty-one patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism from
      Graves' disease were recruited. A titration dosing regimen of thionamide
      anti-thyroid drug (ATD) was used to establish euthyroidism over 12-24 weeks.
      Anthropometric, biochemical and adipocytokine parameters were measured before and
      after control of hyperthyroidism. BAT activity was quantified by fusion 18
      F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET/MR imaging, and patients were grouped based
      on BAT status. Plasma adiponectin level was significantly increased following
      correction of hyperthyroidism in the overall sample. Free thyroxine (FT4) was
      also identified as a predictor of adiponectin level in thyroid dysfunction.
      However, significant changes in adiponectin level and correlations involving
      adiponectin were absent in BAT-positive patients but maintained in BAT-negative
      patients. BAT activity diminishes the correlative relationship with body
      composition and abolishes TH and adiponectin relationships when transitioning
      from a hyperthyroid to euthyroid state.

TI  - Nontuberculous Mycobacteria: Ecology and Impact on Animal and Human Health.
LID - 1516 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10081516 [doi]
AB  - Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) represent an important group of environmentally
      saprophytic and potentially pathogenic bacteria that can cause serious
      mycobacterioses in humans and animals. The sources of infections often remain
      undetected except for soil- or water-borne, water-washed, water-based, or
      water-related infections caused by groups of the Mycobacterium (M.) avium
      complex; M. fortuitum; and other NTM species, including M. marinum infection,
      known as fish tank granuloma, and M. ulcerans infection, which is described as a 
      Buruli ulcer. NTM could be considered as water-borne, air-borne, and soil-borne
      pathogens (sapronoses). A lot of clinically relevant NTM species could be
      considered due to the enormity of published data on permanent, periodic,
      transient, and incidental sapronoses. Interest is currently increasing in
      mycobacterioses diagnosed in humans and husbandry animals (esp. pigs) caused by
      NTM species present in peat bogs, potting soil, garden peat, bat and bird guano, 
      and other matrices used as garden fertilizers. NTM are present in dust particles 
      and in water aerosols, which represent certain factors during aerogenous
      infection in immunosuppressed host organisms during hospitalization,
      speleotherapy, and leisure activities. For this Special Issue, a collection of
      articles providing a current view of the research on NTM-including the clinical
      relevance, therapy, prevention of mycobacterioses, epidemiology, and ecology-are 
      addressed.

TI  - Corin Deficiency Alters Adipose Tissue Phenotype and Impairs Thermogenesis in
      Mice.
LID - 1101 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11081101 [doi]
AB  - Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a key regulator in body fluid balance and
      cardiovascular biology. In addition to its role in enhancing natriuresis and
      vasodilation, ANP increases lipolysis and thermogenesis in adipose tissue. Corin 
      is a protease responsible for ANP activation. It remains unknown if corin has a
      role in regulating adipose tissue function. Here, we examined adipose tissue
      morphology and function in corin knockout (KO) mice. We observed increased
      weights and cell sizes in white adipose tissue (WAT), decreased levels of
      uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), a brown adipocyte marker in WAT and brown adipose
      tissue (BAT), and suppressed thermogenic gene expression in BAT from corin KO
      mice. At regular room temperature, corin KO and wild-type mice had similar
      metabolic rates. Upon cold exposure at 4 degrees C, corin KO mice exhibited
      impaired thermogenic responses and developed hypothermia. In BAT from corin KO
      mice, the signaling pathway of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor c coactivator 1a, and Ucp1 was impaired. In cell 
      culture, ANP treatment increased Ucp1 expression in BAT-derived adipocytes from
      corin KO mice. These data indicate that corin mediated-ANP activation is an
      important hormonal mechanism in regulating adipose tissue function and body
      temperature upon cold exposure in mice.

TI  - Adalimumab Biosimilar GP2017 versus Adalimumab Originator in Treating Patients
      with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Real-Life, Multicenter, Observational Study.
LID - 1799 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10081799 [doi]
AB  - The approval of adalimumab (ADA) biosimilars for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      has reduced the cost of treatment. While several ADA biosimilars are currently
      available, comparative data on the ADA biosimilar GP2017 (Hyrimoz(TM)) and its
      originator (Humira(TM)) in IBD are lacking. We compared the efficacy and safety
      of GP2017 versus originator in IBD outpatients in an Italian real-life setting.
      This retrospective analysis enrolled consecutive IBD patients with complete
      clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic data. Clinical activity was assessed with
      the Mayo score in ulcerative colitis (UC) and the Harvey-Bradshaw Index in
      Crohn's disease (CD). The primary endpoints were the induction of remission and
      the safety of GP2017 versus ADA originator. One hundred and thirty-four patients 
      (30.6% with UC and 69.4% with CD, median age 38 years) were enrolled: 62 (46.3%) 
      patients were treated with GP2017, and 72 (53.7%) with ADA originator; 118
      (88.1%) patients were naive to ADA. Clinical remission was obtained in 105
      (78.4%) patients, during a median follow-up of 12 months, 82.3% and 75% in the
      GP2017 and ADA originator groups, respectively (p = 0.311). Treatment was well
      tolerated in both groups. This analysis of real-world data suggests that GP2017
      and its originator are equivalent in terms of efficacy and safety in patients
      with IBD.

TI  - Genomewide Analysis and Biological Characterization of Cathelicidins with Potent 
      Antimicrobial Activity and Low Cytotoxicity from Three Bat Species.
LID - 989 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11080989 [doi]
AB  - Cathelicidins are potent antimicrobial peptides with broad spectrum antimicrobial
      activity in many vertebrates and an important component of the innate immune
      system. However, our understanding of the genetic variations and biological
      characteristics of bat cathelicidins is limited. In this study, we performed
      genome-level analysis of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidins from seven bat
      species in the six families, listed 19 cathelicidin-like sequences, and showed
      that the number of functional cathelicidin genes differed among bat species.
      Based on the identified biochemical characteristics of bat cathelicidins, three
      cathelicidins, HA-CATH (from Hipposideros armiger), ML-CATH (from Myotis
      lucifugus), and PD-CATH (from Phyllostomus discolor), with clear antimicrobial
      signatures were chemically synthesized and evaluated antimicrobial activity.
      HA-CATH showed narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity against a panel of 12
      reference bacteria, comprising 6 Gram-negative and 6 Gram-positive strains.
      However, ML-CATH and PD-CATH showed potent antibacterial activity against a broad
      spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) of 1 and 3 mug/mL, respectively, against Staphylococcus
      aureus. ML-CATH and PD-CATH also showed antifungal activities against Candida
      albicans and Cryptococcus cuniculi with MIC of 5 to 40 mug/mL, respectively, and 
      80% inhibition of the metabolism of Mucor hiemalis hyphae at 80 mug/mL, while
      displaying minimal cytotoxicity to HaCaT cells. Taken together, although the
      spectrum and efficacy of bat cathelicidins were species-dependent, the
      antimicrobial activity of ML-CATH and PD-CATH was comparable to that of other
      highly active cathelicidins in vertebrates while having negligible cytotoxicity
      to mammalian cells. ML-CATH and PD-CATH can be exploited as promising candidates 
      for the development of antimicrobial therapeutics.

TI  - Exceptional diversity and selection pressure on coronavirus host receptors in
      bats compared to other mammals.
PG  - 20220193
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.0193 [doi]
AB  - Pandemics originating from non-human animals highlight the need to understand how
      natural hosts have evolved in response to emerging human pathogens and which
      groups may be susceptible to infection and/or potential reservoirs to mitigate
      public health and conservation concerns. Multiple zoonotic coronaviruses, such as
      severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2
      and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are
      hypothesized to have evolved in bats. We investigate angiotensin-converting
      enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host protein bound by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and
      dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26), the host protein bound by MERS-CoV, in the
      largest bat datasets to date. Both the ACE2 and DPP4 genes are under strong
      selection pressure in bats, more so than in other mammals, and in residues that
      contact viruses. Additionally, mammalian groups vary in their similarity to
      humans in residues that contact SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and increased 
      similarity to humans in binding residues is broadly predictive of susceptibility 
      to SARS-CoV-2. This work augments our understanding of the relationship between
      coronaviruses and mammals, particularly bats, provides taxonomically diverse data
      for studies of how host proteins are bound by coronaviruses and can inform
      surveillance, conservation and public health efforts.

TI  - Novel Bat Lyssaviruses Identified by Nationwide Passive Surveillance in Taiwan,
      2018-2021.
LID - 1562 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071562 [doi]
AB  - Bat lyssaviruses were identified in Taiwan's bat population during 2016-2017. The
      lyssavirus surveillance system was continuously conducted to understand the
      epidemiology. Through this system, the found dead bats were collected for
      lyssavirus detection by direct fluorescent antibody test and reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction. Three bats were identified as positive
      during 2018-2021. A novel lyssavirus, designated as Taiwan bat lyssavirus 2, was 
      detected in a Nyctalus plancyi velutinus. This lyssavirus had less than 80%
      nucleotide identity in the nucleoprotein (N) gene with other lyssavirus species, 
      forming a separate branch in the phylogenetic analysis. The other two cases were 
      identified in Pipistrellus abramus (Japanese pipistrelles); they were identified 
      to be similar to the former lyssavirus identified in 2016-2017, which was
      renominated as Taiwan bat lyssavirus 1 (TWBLV-1) in this study. Even though one
      of the TWBLV-1 isolates showed high genetic diversity in the N gene compared with
      other TWBLV-1 isolates, it may be a TWBLV-1 variant but not a new species based
      on its high amino acid identities in the nucleoprotein, same host species, and
      same geographic location as the other TWBLV-1.

TI  - Origins and Evolution of Seasonal Human Coronaviruses.
LID - 1551 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071551 [doi]
AB  - Four seasonal human coronaviruses (sHCoVs) are endemic globally (229E, NL63,
      OC43, and HKU1), accounting for 5-30% of human respiratory infections. However,
      the epidemiology and evolution of these CoVs remain understudied due to their
      association with mild symptomatology. Using a multigene and complete genome
      analysis approach, we find the evolutionary histories of sHCoVs to be highly
      complex, owing to frequent recombination of CoVs including within and between
      sHCoVs, and uncertain, due to the under sampling of non-human viruses. The
      recombination rate was highest for 229E and OC43 whereas substitutions per
      recombination event were highest in NL63 and HKU1. Depending on the gene studied,
      OC43 may have ungulate, canine, or rabbit CoV ancestors. 229E may have origins in
      a bat, camel, or an unsampled intermediate host. HKU1 had the earliest common
      ancestor (1809-1899) but fell into two distinct clades (genotypes A and B),
      possibly representing two independent transmission events from murine-origin CoVs
      that appear to be a single introduction due to large gaps in the sampling of CoVs
      in animals. In fact, genotype B was genetically more diverse than all the other
      sHCoVs. Finally, we found shared amino acid substitutions in multiple proteins
      along the non-human to sHCoV host-jump branches. The complex evolution of CoVs
      and their frequent host switches could benefit from continued surveillance of
      CoVs across non-human hosts.

TI  - Genomic Comparisons of Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses from Korean Bats.
LID - 1389 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071389 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses are well known as a diverse family of viruses that affect a wide
      range of hosts. Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, a
      variety of bat-associated coronaviruses have been identified in many countries.
      However, they do not represent all the specific geographic locations of their
      hosts. In this study, full-length genomes representing newly identified bat
      coronaviruses in South Korea were obtained using an RNA sequencing approach. The 
      analysis, based on genome structure, conserved replicase domains, spike gene, and
      nucleocapsid genes revealed that bat Alphacoronaviruses are from three different 
      viral species. Among them, the newly identified B20-97 strain may represent a new
      putative species, closely related to PEDV. In addition, the newly-identified
      MERS-related coronavirus exhibited shared genomic nucleotide identities of less
      than 76.4% with other Merbecoviruses. Recombination analysis and multiple
      alignments of spike and RBD amino acid sequences suggested that this strain
      underwent recombination events and could possibly use hDPP4 molecules as its
      receptor. The bat SARS-related CoV B20-50 is unlikely to be able to use hACE2 as 
      its receptor and lack of an open reading frame in ORF8 gene region. Our results
      illustrate the diversity of coronaviruses in Korean bats and their evolutionary
      relationships. The evolution of the bat coronaviruses related ORF8 accessory gene
      is also discussed.

TI  - Human Coronavirus Spike Protein Based Multi-Epitope Vaccine against COVID-19 and 
      Potential Future Zoonotic Coronaviruses by Using Immunoinformatic Approaches.
LID - 1150 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10071150 [doi]
AB  - Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged twice and have caused severe
      respiratory diseases in humans. Due to the frequent outbreaks of different human 
      coronaviruses (HCoVs), the development of a pan-HCoV vaccine is of great
      importance. Various conserved epitopes shared by HCoVs are reported to induce
      cross-reactive T-cell responses. Therefore, this study aimed to design a
      multi-epitope vaccine, targeting the HCoV spike protein. Genetic analysis
      revealed that the spike region is highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV, 
      and SARS-CoV. By employing the immunoinformatic approach, we prioritized 20 MHC I
      and 10 MHCII conserved epitopes to design a multi-epitope vaccine. This vaccine
      candidate is anticipated to strongly elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune
      responses. These results warrant further development of this vaccine into
      real-world application.

TI  - Nanoindentation of Multifunctional Smart Composites.
LID - 2945 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14142945 [doi]
AB  - Three multifunctional smart composites for next-generation applications have been
      studied differently through versatile nanoindentation investigation techniques.
      They are used in order to determine peculiarities and specific properties for the
      different composites and to study the charge/matrix, charge/surface, or smart
      functions interactions. At first, a mapping indentation test was used to check
      the distribution of hardness and modulus across a large region to examine any
      non-uniformity due to structural anomalies or changes in properties for a carbon 
      nanotubes (CNTs)-reinforced polypropylene (PP V-2) nanocomposite. This smart
      composite is suitable to be used in axial impeller fans and the results can be
      used to improve the process of the composite produced by injection moulding.
      Secondly, the interfacial properties of the carbon fibre (CF) and the resin were 
      evaluated by a push-out method utilizing the smaller indentation tip to target
      the individual CF and apply load to measure its displacement under loads. This is
      useful to evaluate the effectiveness of the surface modification on the CFs, such
      as sizing. Finally, nanoindentation at different temperatures was used for the
      probing of the in situ response of smart shape memory polymer composite (SMPC)
      usable in grabbing devices for aerospace applications. Furthermore, the
      triggering temperature of the shape memory polymer response can be determined by 
      observing the change of indentations after the heating and cooling cycles.

TI  - Light Quality Modulates Photosynthesis and Antioxidant Properties of B. vulgaris 
      L. Plants from Seeds Irradiated with High-Energy Heavy Ions: Implications for
      Cultivation in Space.
LID - 1816 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11141816 [doi]
AB  - Beta vulgaris L. is a crop selected for cultivation in Space for its nutritional 
      properties. However, exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) can alter plant
      photosynthetic performance and phytochemical production in the extraterrestrial
      environment. This study investigated if plant growth under different light
      quality regimes (FL-white fluorescent; RGB-red-green-blue; RB-red-blue) modifies 
      the photosynthetic behavior and bioactive compound synthesis of plants sprouted
      by dry seeds irradiated with carbon or titanium high-energy ions. The study
      evidenced that: (i) the plant response depends on the type of heavyion; (ii)
      control and C-ion-irradiated plants were similar for photosynthetic pigment
      content and PSII photochemical efficiency, regardless of the LQ regime; (iii)
      under FL, net photosynthesis (AN) and water use efficiency (iWUE) declined in C- 
      and Ti-ion plants compared to control, while the growth of irradiated plants
      under RGB and RB regimes offset these differences; (iv) the interaction Ti-ionx
      RB improved iWUE, and stimulated the production of pigments, carbohydrates, and
      antioxidants. The overall results highlighted that the cultivation of irradiated 
      plants under specific LQ regimes effectively regulates photosynthesis and
      bioactive compound amounts in leaf edible tissues. In particular, the interaction
      Ti-ion x RB improved iWUE and increased pigments, carbohydrates, and antioxidant 
      content.

TI  - A First Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Circulation in Bats of Central-Southern Italy.
LID - 742 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070742 [doi]
AB  - One serious concern associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is that the virus
      might spill back from humans to wildlife, which would render some animal species 
      reservoirs of the human virus. We assessed the potential circulation of
      SARS-CoV-2 caused by reverse infection from humans to bats, by performing bat
      surveillance from different sites in Central-Southern Italy. We restricted our
      survey to sampling techniques that are minimally invasive and can therefore be
      broadly applied by non-medical operators such as bat workers. We collected 240
      droppings or saliva from 129 bats and tested them using specific and general
      primers for SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses, respectively. All samples (127 nasal
      swabs and 113 faecal droppings) were negative for SARS-CoV-2, and these results
      were confirmed by testing the samples with the Droplet Digital PCR. Additionally,
      pancoronavirus end-point RT-PCR was performed, and no sample showed specific
      bands. This outcome is a first step towards a better understanding of the reverse
      transmission of this virus to bats. Although the occurrence of a reverse zoonotic
      pattern can only be fully established by serological testing, the latter might
      represent an in-depth follow-up to a broad-scale preliminary assessment performed
      with our approach. We encourage the systematic surveillance of bats to help
      prevent reverse zoonotic episodes that would jeopardize human health, as well as 
      biodiversity conservation and management.

TI  - Essential Amino Acids-Rich Diet Decreased Adipose Tissue Storage in Adult Mice: A
      Preliminary Histopathological Study.
LID - 2915 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142915 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excess body adipose tissue accumulation is a common and growing
      health problem caused by an unbalanced diet and/or junk food. Although the
      effects of dietary fat and glucose on lipid metabolism regulation are well known,
      those of essential amino acids (EAAs) have been poorly investigated. Our aim was 
      to study the influence of a special diet containing all EAAs on retroperitoneal
      white adipose tissue (rpWAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) of
      mice. METHODS: Two groups of male Balb/C mice were used. The first was fed with a
      standard diet. The second was fed with an EAAs-rich diet (EAARD). After 3 weeks, 
      rpWAT and BAT were removed and prepared for subsequent immunohistochemical
      analysis. RESULTS: EAARD, although consumed significantly less, moderately
      reduced body weight and BAT, but caused a massive reduction in rpWAT. Conversely,
      the triceps muscle increased in mass. In rpWAT, the size of adipocytes was very
      small, with increases in leptin, adiponectin and IL-6 immunostaining. In BAT,
      there was a reduction in lipid droplet size and a simultaneous increase in UCP-1 
      and SIRT-3. CONCLUSIONS: A diet containing a balanced mixture of free EAA may
      modulate body adiposity in mice, promoting increased thermogenesis.

TI  - Seabuckthorn Reverses High-Fat-Diet-Induced Obesity and Enhances Fat Browning via
      Activation of AMPK/SIRT1 Pathway.
LID - 2903 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142903 [doi]
AB  - Seabuckthorn possesses various bioactive compounds and exhibits several positive 
      pharmacological activities. The present trial aims to determine the effect of
      seabuckthorn powder intake on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity prevention in
      mice. The results suggest that seabuckthorn powder intake decreased body weight, 
      fat mass, and circulating lipid levels, and improved insulin sensitivity in
      HFD-fed mice. Moreover, dietary seabuckthorn powder alleviated hepatic steatosis 
      and hepatic lipid accumulation induced by the HFD. Furthermore, seabuckthorn
      exhibited obvious anti-inflammatory capacity in white adipose tissue (WAT) by
      regulating the abundance of inflammation-related cytokines, such as interleukins 
      4, 6, and 10; tumor necrosis factor alpha; and interferon-gamma. More
      importantly, dietary seabuckthorn powder promoted a thermogenic program in BAT
      and induced beige adipocyte formation in iWAT in HFD-fed mice. Interestingly, we 
      found that seabuckthorn powder effectively restored AMPK and SIRT1 activities in 
      both BAT and iWAT in HFD-fed mice. Collectively, these results potentiate the
      application of seabuckthorn powder as a nutritional intervention strategy to
      prevent obesity and related metabolic diseases by promoting thermogenesis in BAT 
      and improving beige adipocyte formation in WAT.

TI  - Exogenous Nucleotides Improved the Oxidative Stress and Sirt-1 Protein Level of
      Brown Adipose Tissue on Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone-8 (SAMP8) Mice.
LID - 2796 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142796 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is of great importance in rodents for maintaining
      their core temperature via non-shivering thermogenesis in the mitochondria. BAT's
      thermogenic function has been shown to decline with age. The activation of
      adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase/sirtuin-1 (AMPK/Sirt-1)
      is effective in regulating mitochondrial function. Exogenous nucleotides (NTs)
      are regulatory factors in many biological processes. Nicotinamide mononucleotide 
      (NMN), which is a derivative of NTs, is widely known as a Sirt-1 activator in
      liver and muscle, but the effect of NMN and NTs on aging BAT has not been studied
      before. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of NTs on aging
      senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mice. Senescence-accelerated mouse
      resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice were set as the model control group and NMN was used as 
      the positive control. Male, 3 month old SAMP8 mice were divided into the
      SAMP8-normal chow (SAMP8-NC), SAMP8-young-normal chow (SAMP8-young-NC), NMN,
      NTs-free, NTs-low, NTs-medium, and NTs-high groups for long-term feeding. After 9
      months of intervention, interscapular BAT was collected for experiments. Compared
      to the SAMP8-NC, the body weight and BAT mass were significantly improved in the 
      NT-treated aging SAMP8 mice. NT supplementation had effects on oxidative stress
      in BAT. The concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) was reduced and that of
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased significantly. Meanwhile, the expression of 
      the brown adipocyte markers uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactlvator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and PR
      domain zinc finger protein 16 (PRDM16) were upregulated. The upregulated proteins
      may be activated via the Sirt-1 pathway. Thus, NT supplementation may be helpful 
      to improve the thermogenesis of BAT by reducing oxidative stress and activating
      the Sirt-1 pathway.

TI  - Detection of Unprecedented CYP74 Enzyme in Mammal: Hydroperoxide Lyase CYP74C44
      of the Bat Sturnira hondurensis.
LID - 8009 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23148009 [doi]
AB  - The genome of the neotropical fruit bat Sturnira hondurensis was recently
      sequenced, revealing an unexpected gene encoding a plant-like protein, CYP74C44, 
      which shares ca. 90% sequence identity with the putative CYP74C of Populus
      trichocarpa. The preparation and properties of the recombinant CYP74C44 are
      described in the present work. The CYP74C44 enzyme was found to be active against
      the 13- and 9-hydroperoxides of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids (13-HPOD,
      13-HPOT, 9-HPOD, and 9-HPOT, respectively), as well as the 15-hydroperoxide of
      eicosapentaenoic acid (15-HPEPE). All substrates studied were specifically
      transformed into chain cleavage products that are typical for hydroperoxide
      lyases (HPLs). The HPL chain cleavage reaction was validated by the
      identification of NaBH4-reduced products (Me/TMS) of 15-HPEPE and 13- and
      9-hydroperoxides as (all-Z)-14-hydroxy-5,8,11-tetradecatrienoic,
      (9Z)-12-hydroxy-9-dodecenoic, and 9-hydroxynonanoic acids (Me/TMS), respectively.
      Thus, CYP74C44 possessed the HPL activity that is typical for the CYP74C
      subfamily proteins.

TI  - Factors Associated with White Fat Browning: New Regulators of Lipid Metabolism.
LID - 7641 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147641 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian adipose tissue can be divided into white and brown adipose tissue based
      on its colour, location, and cellular structure. Certain conditions, such as
      sympathetic nerve excitement, can induce the white adipose adipocytes into a new 
      type of adipocytes, known as beige adipocytes. The process, leading to the
      conversion of white adipocytes into beige adipocytes, is called white fat
      browning. The dynamic balance between white and beige adipocytes is closely
      related to the body's metabolic homeostasis. Studying the signal transduction
      pathways of the white fat browning might provide novel ideas for the treatment of
      obesity and alleviation of obesity-related glucose and lipid metabolism
      disorders. This article aimed to provide an overview of recent advances in
      understanding white fat browning and the role of BAT in lipid metabolism.

TI  - Italian Validation of the 12-Item Version of the Burnout Assessment Tool
      (BAT-12).
LID - 8562 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148562 [doi]
AB  - The Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT) has shown satisfactory validity evidence in
      several countries, with the 23-item version of the instrument reporting adequate 
      psychometric properties also in the Italian context. This paper is aimed to
      present results from the Italian validation of the 12-item version of the BAT.
      Based on a sample of 2277 workers, our results supported the factorial validity
      of a higher-order model represented by 4 first-order factors corresponding to the
      core dimensions of burnout, namely exhaustion, mental distance, and emotional and
      cognitive impairment. The measure invariance of the BAT-12 between data collected
      before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was supported. However, ANCOVA results
      suggest a higher score on the second-order burnout factor on data collected
      during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with earlier data. In line with the
      JD-R model, the BAT-12 total score reported a positive association with job
      demands (i.e., workload, time pressure, and role conflict) and a negative
      association with job resources (i.e., job autonomy, coworkers' support) and
      personal resources (i.e., optimism, social self-efficacy, and task
      self-efficacy). Additionally, the BAT-12 showed a negative association with work 
      engagement components (i.e., vigor, dedication, and absorption) and positive job 
      attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction, affective commitment). All in all, our results
      identify the Italian version of the BAT-12 as a brief and reliable tool for
      measuring burnout among workers.

TI  - The Effects of Catabolism Relationships of Leucine and Isoleucine with BAT2 Gene 
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on High Alcohols and Esters.
LID - 1178 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071178 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to provide a theoretical basis for effectively controlling the 
      content of higher alcohols and esters in fermented foods. In this work,
      isoleucine (Ile) or leucine (Leu) at high levels was used as the sole nitrogen
      source for a BAT2 mutant and its parental Saccharomyces. cerevisiae 38 to
      investigate the effects of the addition of amounts of Ile or Leu and BAT2 on the 
      aroma components in the flavor profile using gas chromatography mass spectrometer
      (GC-MS). The results showed that 2-methyl-butyraldehyde, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 
      2-methylbutyl-acetate were the products positively correlated with the Ile
      addition amount. In addition, 3-methyl-butyraldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and
      3-methylbutyl-acetate were the products positively correlated with Leu addition
      amount. BAT2 deletion resulted in a significant decline in the yields of
      2-methyl-butyraldehyde, 3-methyl-butyraldehyde,2-methyl-1-butanol, and
      3-methyl-1-butanol, but also an increase in the yields of 2-methylbutyl-acetate
      and 3-methylbutyl-acetate. We speculated that BAT2 regulated the front and end of
      this metabolite chain in a feedback manner. Improved metabolic chain analyses,
      including the simulated energy metabolism of Ile or Leu, indicated that reducing 
      the added amount of branched-chain amino acids, BAT mutation, and eliminating the
      role of energy cofactors such as NADH/NAD+ were three important ways to control
      the content of high alcohols and esters in fermented foods.

AB  - Nowadays a possible strategy in food preservation consists of the use of active
      and functional packaging to improve safety and ensure a longer shelf life of food
      products. Many studies refer to chitosan-based films because of the already-known
      chitosan (CH) antibacterial and antifungal activity. In this work, we developed
      CH-based films containing Dried Olive Leaf Extract (DOLE) obtained by Naviglio
      extractor, with the aim to investigate the polyphenols yield and the antioxidant 
      activity of this extract entrapped in CH-based-edible films. Olive tree
      cultivation produces a huge amount of byproducts that are usually simply burned. 
      Phenolic compounds are already studied for their beneficial effects on human
      health. Some studies reported that phenols isolated from olive leaves have been
      shown to inhibit the growth of different strains of microorganisms. Thus, the
      antimicrobial effect of DOLE-containing films against bacterial strains
      (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC((R)) 14028,
      Salmonella enteritidis RIVM 706, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC((R)) 29212) was
      tested in vitro. The DOLE component of the films is effective in inhibiting all
      the bacteria tested in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, it was demonstrated that
      these edible films can act as active bioplastics when used to wrap hamburgers in 
      substitution for baking paper, which is normally used.

      Mouse.

AB  - Calcium signaling is crucial for many physiological processes and can mobilize
      intracellular calcium stores in response to environmental sensory stimuli. The
      endolysosomal two-pore channel (TPC), regulated by the second messenger nicotinic
      acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), is one of the key components in
      calcium signaling. However, its role in neuronal physiology remains largely
      unknown. Here, we investigated to what extent the acoustic thresholds differed
      between the WT mice and the TPC KO mice. We determined the thresholds based on
      the auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at five frequencies (between 4 and 32
      kHz) and found no threshold difference between the WT and KO in virgin female
      mice. Surprisingly, in lactating mothers (at P9-P10), the thresholds were higher 
      from 8 to 32 kHz in the TPC KO mice compared to the WT mice. This result
      indicates that in the TPC KO mice, physiological events occurring during
      parturition altered the detection of sounds already at the brainstem level, or
      even earlier.

TI  - Aquatic Pollution and Risks to Biodiversity: The Example of Cocaine Effects on
      the Ovaries of Anguilla anguilla.
LID - 1766 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141766 [doi]
AB  - Pollution is one of the main causes of the loss of biodiversity, currently one of
      the most important environmental problems. Important sources of aquatic pollution
      are illicit drugs, whose presence in waters is closely related to human
      consumption; their psychoactive properties and biological activity suggest
      potential adverse effects on non-target organisms, such as aquatic biota. In this
      study, we evaluated the effect of an environmentally relevant concentration of
      cocaine (20 ng L(-1)), an illicit drug widely found in surface waters, on the
      ovaries of Anguilla anguilla, a species critically endangered and able to
      accumulate cocaine in its tissues following chronic exposure. The following
      parameters were evaluated: (1) the morphology of the ovaries; (2) the presence
      and distribution of enzymes involved in oogenesis; (3) serum cortisol, FSH, and
      LH levels. The eels exposed to cocaine showed a smaller follicular area and a
      higher percentage of connective tissue than controls (p &lt; 0.05), as well as
      many previtellogenic oocytes compared with controls having numerous fully
      vitellogenic and early vitellogenic oocytes. In addition, the presence and
      location of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid
      dehydrogenase, and P450 aromatase differed in the two groups. Finally, cocaine
      exposure decreased FSH and LH levels, while it increased cortisol levels. These
      findings show that even a low environmental concentration of cocaine affects the 
      ovarian morphology and activity of A. anguilla, suggesting a potential impact on 
      reproduction in this species.

      cannabinoid receptors in adult rats.

AB  - AIMS: The endocannabinoid system (ECS) increases food intake, appetite for fat
      and lipogenesis, while decreases energy expenditure (thermogenesis), contributing
      to metabolic dysfunctions. We demonstrated that maternal high-fat diet (HFD)
      alters cannabinoid signaling in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of neonate and
      weanling male rat offspring, which have increased adiposity but also higher
      energy expenditure in adulthood. In this study, the main objective was to
      investigate the ECS expression in thermogenic tissues as BAT and skeletal muscle 
      of adult rats programmed by maternal HFD. We hypothesized that maternal HFD would
      modulate ECS and energy metabolism markers in BAT and skeletal muscle of adult
      male offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female rats received standard diet (9.4 % 
      of calories as fat) or isocaloric HFD (28.9 % of calories as fat) for 8 weeks
      premating and throughout gestation and lactation. Male offspring were weaned on
      standard diet and euthanatized in adulthood. KEY FINDINGS: Maternal HFD increased
      body weight, adiposity, glycemia, leptinemia while decreased testosterone levels 
      in adult offspring. Maternal HFD did not change cannabinoid receptors in BAT or
      skeletal muscle as hypothesized but increased the content of uncoupling protein
      and tyrosine hydroxylase (thermogenic markers) in parallel to changes in
      mitochondrial morphology in skeletal muscle of adult offspring. SIGNIFICANCE: In 
      metabolic programming models, the ECS modulation in the BAT and skeletal muscle
      may be more important early in life to adapt energy metabolism during maternal
      dietary insult, and other mechanisms are possibly involved in muscle metabolism
      long-term regulation.

LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104583 [doi]
AB  - As human populations left Asia to first settle in Oceania around 50,000 years
      ago, they entered a territory ecologically separated from the Old World for
      millions of years. We analyzed genomic data of 239 modern Oceanian individuals to
      detect and date signals of selection specific to this region. Combining both
      relative and absolute dating approaches, we identified a strong selection pattern
      between 52,000 and 54,000 years ago in the genomes of descendants of the first
      settlers of Sahul. This strikingly corresponds to the dates of initial settlement
      as inferred from archaeological evidence. Loci under selection during this
      period, some showing enrichment in Denisovan ancestry, overlap genes involved in 
      the immune response and diet, especially based on plants. Pathogens and natural
      resources, especially from endemic plants, therefore appear to have acted as
      strong selective pressures on the genomes of the first settlers of Sahul.

      Syndrome (AGS).
PG  - 957-970
LID - 10.2147/JAA.S265660 [doi]
AB  - The alpha-Gal syndrome (AGS) is a pathognomonic immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated
      delayed anaphylaxis in foods containing the oligosaccharide
      galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-Gal) such as mammalian meat or dairy
      products. Clinical presentation of AGS can also comprise immediate
      hypersensitivity due to anticancer therapy, gelatin-containing vaccines or
      mammalian serum-based antivenom. The IgE initial sensitization is caused by
      hard-bodied tick bites and symptomatic individuals typically develop delayed
      pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, malaise or gut-related symptoms.
      Due to inapparent presentation, delayed reactions and a wide variety of patients 
      clinical history, the AGS diagnosis and treatment remain challenging. This review
      covers not only current diagnostic methods used for AGS such as the skin prick
      test (SPT), the oral food challenge (OFC), anti-alpha-Gal IgE levels measurement 
      and the basophil activation test (BAT), but also potentially relevant
      next-generation diagnostic tools like the mast cell activation test (MAT), the
      histamine-release (HR) assay, omics technologies and model-based reasoning (MBR).
      Moreover, it focuses on the therapeutical medical and non-medical methods
      available and current research methods that are being applied in order to
      elucidate the molecular, physiological and immune mechanisms underlying this
      allergic disorder. Lastly, future treatment and preventive tools are also
      discussed, being of utmost importance for the identification of tick salivary
      molecules, with or without alpha-Gal modifications, that trigger IgE sensitivity 
      as they could be the key for further vaccine development. Bearing in mind climate
      change, the tick-host paradigm will shift towards an increasing number of AGS
      cases in new regions worldwide, which will pose new challenges for clinicians in 
      the future.

AB  - Obesity has become a very important public health problem and is increasing
      globally. Genetics, individual and environmental factors play roles in the
      etiology of this complex disorder. Recently, several environmental pollutants
      have been suggested to have obesogenic activities. Peroxisome proliferator
      activating receptor gamma (PPARgamma), uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) and their
      expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) play key 
      roles in adipogenesis. UCP3 and irisin were reported to play roles in
      non-shivering thermogenesis. Our primary aim was to investigate obesogenic
      effects of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and
      dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) in rats. In addition, thermoregulatory
      effects of HCB, DDT and DDE were also investigated by analyzing the levels of
      Ucp3 and irisin. Thirty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided 
      into four groups as control, HCB, DDT and DDE. Animals were administered with
      organochlorine pesticides (OCPs; 5 mg/kg bw) by oral gavage every other day for
      five weeks. At the end of the experimental period, the animals were sacrificed,
      BAT and WAT samples were collected to analyze Ppargamma, Ucp1 and Ucp3 levels.
      Moreover, skeletal muscle samples were collected to examine Ucp3 and irisin
      levels. Serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were also determined. 
      Body weight and core temperature of the animals were not significantly affected
      by any of the OCP administration. Serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride
      levels were similar among the experimental groups. Ppargamma expression was
      significantly elevated by HCB administration only in WAT (p < 0.05). On the other
      hand, both Ppargamma and Ucp1 expressions were diminished in WAT and BAT (p <
      0.01) by DDT treatment, while in WAT, DDE significantly decreased Ppargamma
      expression without altering its expression in BAT (p < 0.001). Ucp3 and irisin
      levels in skeletal muscle were not altered. Our findings show that both DDT and
      DDE reduce the browning of WAT by suppressing white adipocytes and thus may have 
      obesogenic activity in male rats without altering thermoregulation. In addition, 
      HCB, DDT and DDE-induced alterations in expression of Ppargamma and Ucp1 in WAT
      implicates differential regulation of adipogenic processes.

TI  - New Insights into Chemical and Biological Properties of Funicone-like Compounds.
LID - 466 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14070466 [doi]
AB  - Funicone-like compounds are a homogeneous group of polyketides that, so far, have
      only been reported as fungal secondary metabolites. In particular, species in the
      genus Talaromyces seem to be the most typical producers of this group of
      secondary metabolites. The molecular structure of funicone, the archetype of
      these products, is characterized by a gamma-pyrone ring linked through a ketone
      group to a alpha-resorcylic acid nucleus. This review provides an update on the
      current knowledge on the chemistry of funicone-like compounds, with special
      emphasis on their classification, occurrence, and diverse biological activities. 
      In addition, their potential relevance as mycotoxins is discussed.

TI  - beta-Carotene from the Alga Dunaliella bardawil Decreases Gene Expression of
      Adipose Tissue Macrophage Recruitment Markers and Plasma Lipid Concentrations in 
      Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.
LID - 433 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20070433 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids are involved in the regulation of adipose 
      tissue metabolism and inflammation. We examined the effect of dietary
      supplementation using all-trans and 9-cis beta-carotene-rich Dunaliella bardawil 
      alga as the sole source of vitamin A on obesity-associated comorbidities and
      adipose tissue dysfunction in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Three-week-old 
      male mice (C57BL/6) were randomly allocated into two groups and fed a high-fat,
      vitamin A-deficient diet supplemented with either vitamin A (HFD) or
      beta-carotene (BC) (HFD-BC). Vitamin A levels in the liver, WATs, and BAT of the 
      HFD-BC group were 1.5-2.4-fold higher than of the HFD group. BC concentrations
      were 5-6-fold greater in BAT compared to WAT in the HFD-BC group. The eWAT mRNA
      levels of the Mcp-1 and Cd68 were 1.6- and 2.1-fold lower, respectively, and the 
      plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were 30% and 28% lower in the 
      HFD-BC group compared with the HFD group. Dietary BC can be the exclusive vitamin
      A source in mice fed a high-fat diet, as shown by the vitamin A concentration in 
      the plasma and tissues. Feeding BC rather than vitamin A reduces adipose tissue
      macrophage recruitment markers and plasma lipid concentrations.

AB  - Overweight and obesity have become worldwide health issues in most countries.
      Current strategies aimed to prevent or reduce overweight and obesity have mainly 
      focused on the genes and molecular mechanisms that give the functional
      characteristics to different types of adipose tissue. The Browning phenomenon in 
      adipocytes consists of phenotypic and metabolic changes within white adipose
      tissue (WAT) activated by thermogenic mechanisms similar to that occurring in
      brown adipose tissue (BAT); this phenomenon has assumed great relevance due to
      its therapeutic potential against overweight and obesity. In addition, the study 
      of inflammation in the development of overweight and obesity has also been
      included as a relevant factor, such as the pro-inflammatory mechanisms promoted
      by M1-type macrophages in adipose tissue. Studies carried out in this area are
      mainly performed by using the 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line, testing different
      bioactive compound sources such as plants and foods; nevertheless, it is
      necessary to standardize protocols used in vitro as well to properly scale them
      to animal models and clinical tests in order to have a better understanding of
      the mechanisms involved in overweight and obesity.

LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c04192 [doi]
AB  - Many existing protein detection strategies depend on highly functionalized
      antibody reagents. A simpler and easier to produce class of detection reagent is 
      highly desirable. We designed a single-component, recombinant, luminescent
      biosensor that can be expressed in laboratory strains of Escherichia coli and
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This biosensor is deployed in multiple homogeneous and 
      immobilized assay formats to detect recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen and
      cultured virus. The chemiluminescent signal generated facilitates detection by an
      unaugmented cell phone camera. Binding-activated tandem split-enzyme (BAT)
      biosensors may serve as a useful template for diagnostics and reagents that
      detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens and other proteins of interest.

      has made it possible to build a remote learning environment for English
      education. The application of fifth-generation communication (5G) has carried out
      revolutions in education for both teachers and students. In this study, an
      optimization approach is presented for English teaching mode to overcome the
      limits of current college English teaching settings and broaden the span of 5G
      technology. The proposed optimization technique varies from traditional college
      English teaching methods in that it integrates 5G, which considerably increases
      the communication of college English classes. Furthermore, the optimization
      technique can promote the standard of English teaching in several ways while
      completely and systematically following the teaching principle of "teach students
      according to their capabilities." In addition, a Bat Optimization Algorithm (BOA)
      is employed to enhance the process of transmission and measure the students'
      cognitive skills. The experimental results show that the proposed method
      addresses the limitations of the traditional English teaching model in colleges
      while enhancing students' cognitive skills in a variety of areas, including
      listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

AB  - Bats perform important ecological roles in our ecosystem. However, recent studies
      have demonstrated that bats are reservoirs of emerging viruses that have spilled 
      over into humans and agricultural animals to cause severe disease. These viruses 
      include Hendra and Nipah paramyxoviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and
      coronaviruses that are closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 
      and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, bats that are naturally or
      experimentally infected with these viruses do not show clinical signs of disease.
      Here we have reviewed ecological, behavioural, and molecular factors that may
      influence the ability of bats to harbour viruses. We have summarized known
      zoonotic potential of bat-borne viruses and stress on the need for further
      studies to better understand the evolutionary relationship between bats and their
      viruses, along with discovering the intrinsic and external factors that
      facilitate the successful spillover of viruses from bats.

TI  - The Role of Adipokines in Pancreatic Cancer.
PG  - 926230
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.926230 [doi]
AB  - In modern society, inappropriate diets and other lifestyle habits have made
      obesity an increasingly prominent health problem. Pancreatic cancer (PC), a kind 
      of highly aggressive malignant tumor, is known as a silent assassin and is the
      seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide, pushing modern medicine beyond
      help. Adipokines are coming into notice because of the role of the intermediate
      regulatory junctions between obesity and malignancy. This review summarizes the
      current evidence for the relationship between highly concerning adipokines and
      the pathogenesis of PC. Not only are classical adipokines such as leptin and
      adiponectin included, but they also cover the recognized chemerin and
      osteopontin. Through a summary of the biological functions of these adipokines as
      well as their receptors, it was discovered that in addition to their basic
      function of stimulating the biological activity of tumors, more studies confirm
      that adipokines intervene in the progression of PC from the viewpoint of tumor
      metabolism, immune escape, and reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment (TME).
      Besides endocrine function, the impact of white adipose tissue (WAT)-induced
      chronic inflammation on PC is briefly discussed. Furthermore, the potential
      implication of the acknowledged endocrine behavior of brown adipose tissue (BAT) 
      in relation to carcinogenesis is also explored. No matter the broad spectrum of
      obesity and the poor prognosis of PC, supplemental research is needed to unravel 
      the detailed network of adipokines associated with PC. Exploiting profound
      therapeutic strategies that target adipokines and their receptors may go some way
      to improving the current worrying prognosis of PC patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a global pandemic. Intermediate horseshoe 
      bats (Rhinolophus affinis) are hosts of RaTG13, the second most phylogenetically 
      related viruses to SARS-CoV-2. We report the binding between intermediate
      horseshoe bat ACE2 (bACE2-Ra) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD),
      supporting the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. A 3.3 A resolution crystal
      structure of the bACE2-Ra/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex was determined. The interaction 
      networks of Patch 1 showed differences in R34 and E35 of bACE2-Ra compared to
      hACE2 and big-eared horseshoe bat ACE2 (bACE2-Rm). The E35K substitution,
      existing in other species, significantly enhanced the binding affinity owing to
      its electrostatic attraction with E484 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Furthermore, bACE2-Ra
      showed extensive support for the SARS-CoV-2 variants. These results broaden our
      knowledge of the ACE2/RBD interaction mechanism and emphasize the importance of
      continued surveillance of intermediate horseshoe bats to prevent spillover risk.

AB  - Considerable attention is currently focused on the potential to switch on brown
      adipose tissue (BAT), or promote browning of white adipose tissue, to elevate
      energy expenditure and thereby reduce obesity levels. These processes are already
      known to be switched on by cold exposure. Yet humans living in colder regions do 
      not show lower levels of obesity. This could be because humans shield themselves 
      from external temperatures, or because the resultant changes in BAT and
      thermogenesis are offset by elevated food intake, or reductions in other
      components of expenditure. We exposed mice to 11 different ambient temperatures
      between 5 and 35 degrees C and characterized their energy balance and body
      weight/composition. As it got colder mice progressively increased their energy
      expenditure coincident with changes in thyroid hormone levels and increased BAT
      activity. Simultaneously, these increases in expenditure were matched by elevated
      food intake, and body mass remained stable. Nevertheless, within this envelope of
      unchanged body mass there were significant changes in body composition - with
      increases in the sizes of the liver and small intestine, presumably to support
      the greater food intake, and reductions in the level of stored fat - maximally
      providing about 10% of the total elevated energy demands. Elevating activity of
      BAT may be a valid strategy to reduce fat storage even if overall body mass is
      unchanged but if it is mostly offset by elevated food intake, as found here, then
      the impacts may be small.

TI  - Impact of medication adherence on the efficacy of Baroreflex activation therapy.
LID - 10.1111/jch.14540 [doi]
AB  - Therapy adherence significantly determines the success of antihypertensive
      therapy, especially in patients with resistant hypertension. Our study
      investigates the impact of drug adherence on the efficacy of
      Baroreflex-activation-therapy (BAT). In this retrospective analysis, the authors 
      measured blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive medication adherence (by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry [GC-MS] urine analysis) before and 6 months
      after BAT initiation. Adherence was defined as detection of >/=80% intake of
      prescribed medication at the time of follow-up. Response to BAT was defined as BP
      drop >/=5 mmHg in systolic 24 h-ambulatory BP (ABP) after 6 months. Overall
      patients (n = 38) median medication adherence was low, but rose from 60% (IQR
      25%-100%) to 75% (IQR 38%-100%; p = .0194). After 6 months of BAT, mean systolic 
      and diastolic office BP (-21 +/- 25 mmHg and -9 +/- 15 mmHg; p < .0001 and .0004)
      as well as 24 h-ABP dropped significantly (-9 +/- 17 mmHg and -5 +/- 12 mmHg; p =
      .0049 and .0280). After 6 months of BAT, 21 patients (60%) could be classified as
      responders. There was neither significant difference in mean office systolic (-21
      +/- 23 mmHg vs. -21 +/- 28 mmHg; p = .9581) nor in 24 h-systolic ABP decrease
      (-11 +/- 19 mmHg vs. -7 +/- 15 mmHg; p = .4450) comparing adherent and
      non-adherent patients. Whereas Antihypertensive Therapeutic Index (ATI) was
      unchanged in non-responders, it significantly decreased in responders (from 50
      +/- 16 to 46 +/- 16; p = .0477). These data are the first to show that
      BAT-initiation leads to a clear BP reduction independently of patients medication
      adherence. Response to BAT is associated with a significant lowering of ATI,
      which might contribute to an underestimation of BAT efficacy.

TI  - Total Synthesis of Ophiorrhine A, G and Ophiorrhiside E Featuring a Bioinspired
      Intramolecular Diels-Alder Cycloaddition.
LID - 10.1002/anie.202209135 [doi]
AB  - We report the first total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloids
      ophiorrhine A via a late stage bioinspired intramolecular Diels-Alder
      cycloaddition to form the intricate bridged and spirannic polycyclic system.
      Several strategies were investigated to construct the indolopyridone moiety of
      ophiorrhiside E, the postulated biosynthetic precursor of ophiorrhine A.
      Eventually, the Friedel-Crafts-type coupling of indolyl-acetamide with
      secologanin-derived acid chloride delivered ophiorrhine G. Cyclodehydration of a 
      protected form of the latter was followed by the desired spontaneous
      intramolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition of protected ophiorrhiside E leading to 
      ophiorrhine A.

TI  - Dimeric phenanthrenoids: possible biogenetic pathway and missing compounds.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/14786419.2022.2103123 [doi]
AB  - Secondary metabolites extracted from plants have historically been critical for
      drug discovery, but their isolation involves expensive and complicated procedures
      in terms of time and labor resources. Thus, the biogenetic pathway offers the
      possibility of identifying specific compounds that have not yet been isolated and
      predicting their isolation from specific natural sources. In plants,
      biphenanthrenes represent a relatively small group of aromatic secondary
      metabolites that are considered as important taxonomic markers with promising
      biological activities. To date, 38 mixed phenanthrenoid dimers have been
      identified, the biosynthesis of which involves the radical coupling of the two
      subunits, namely, a phenanthrene and a dihydrophenanthrene. For each of the
      compounds, it is possible to identify the single phenanthrenic and
      dihydrophenanthrenic units constituting the considered dimer. Based on the
      biogenetic pathway, it is possible to identify 19 phenanthrenes and 17
      dihydrophenanthrenes, and to distinguish those already known from those not yet
      isolated. By comparing the results of the possible biosynthetic pathway for each 
      compound with the data in the literature, it is possible to identify three known 
      phenanthrenes and seven known dihydrophenanthrenes, as well as eleven new
      phenanthrenes and five new dihydrophenanthrenes, and to identify from which plant
      it is possible to isolate them. This could direct the work of researchers seeking
      to identify known or new molecules useful for their possible biological
      properties, and ultimately, to confirm the veracity of the proposed and generally
      accepted biosynthetic pathway.

TI  - Predicted dermal and dietary exposure of bats to pesticides.
LID - 10.1002/etc.5438 [doi]
AB  - Wild birds and mammals that feed in agricultural habitats are potentially exposed
      to pesticides through various routes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
      recently published a statement which concluded that the current EFSA risk
      assessment scheme for birds and mammals does not adequately cover bats
      (Chiroptera). Here we take a more detailed look at the EFSA statement, and
      assumptions made regarding direct (dermal) and indirect (dietary) exposure of
      bats to pesticides, in terms of their realism and the potential implications for 
      risk assessment outcomes. Regarding dietary exposure, errors in the residue per
      unit dose (RUD) values for flying insects (bat food), proposed in the EFSA bat
      statement, were identified and corrected. Lower RUD values, based on a much
      broader data base are proposed. Using these more realistic RUD values, together
      with current assumptions regarding toxicity and exposure, the acute and long-term
      risk to bats appears to be within the range of those calculated for birds and
      ground-dwelling mammals under the current risk assessment scheme. Depending on
      the assumptions made, some uncertainties may remain and should be investigated
      further. According to the EFSA bat statement, dermal exposure of bats is the most
      significant route of exposure, resulting in the highest predicted daily doses. We
      demonstrated that the dermal exposure models in the EFSA bat statement predict
      much higher residues for bats than those measured on other flying organisms that 
      have larger surface area to volume ratios, and thus would be expected to have the
      reverse relationship. We also illustrated that the amounts of spray liquid
      required to achieve the predicted dermal exposures of bats are implausibly high, 
      with bats carrying an amount of spray liquid that exceeds their body weight by
      manyfold. It is recommended that a bat risk assessment framework should be based 
      on realistic, sound science, allowing resources to be focused on those scenarios 
      that are not already covered by the existing bird and mammal framework.
      Therefore, a quantitative risk assessment scheme should not be implemented until 
      the many scientific uncertainties within the EFSA bat statement are addressed.

TI  - Structural variety of niobium(V) polyoxo clusters obtained from the reaction with
      aromatic monocarboxylic acids: isolation of {Nb2O}, {Nb4O4} and {Nb8O12} cores.
LID - 10.1002/chem.202201464 [doi]
AB  - A bstract The reactivity of aryl monocarboxylic acids (benzoic, 1- or 2-naphtoic,
      4'-methylbiphenyl-4-carboxylic and anthracene-9-carboxylic acids) has been
      investigated as complexing agent toward the ethoxide niobium(V) (Nb(OEt) 5
      precursor. A total of 8 coordination complexes has been isolated with distinct
      niobium(V) nuclearities as well as carboxylates complexation states. The use of
      benzoic acid gives to a tetranuclear core Nb 4 (mu 2 -O) 4 ( L ) 4 (OEt) 8 ] ( L 
      = benzoate ( 1 )) exhibiting four Nb-(mu 2 -O)-Nb linkages in a square plane
      configuration. A similar tetramer ( 7 ) is obtained with 2-naphtoic acid by using
      a 55% humidity atmosphere synthetic route. Two types of dinuclear bricks has been
      identified with one central Nb-(mu 2 -O)-Nb linkages, and differ by the
      complexation state, with one bridging carboxylate ([Nb 2 (mu 2 -O)(mu 2 -OEt)( L 
      )(OEt) 6 ], with L = 1-naphtoate ( 3) & L = anthracene-9-carboxylate ( 5 )) or
      two bridging carboxylate groups ([Nb 2 (mu 2 -O)( L ) 2 (OEt) 6 ], with L =
      4'-methylbiphenyl-4-carboxylic ( 4) & L = anthracene-9-carboxylate ( 6 )). An
      octanuclear moiety [Nb 8 (mu 2 -O) 12 ( L ) 8 (eta 1 - L ) 4-x (OEt) 4+x ] (with 
      L = 2-naphtoate, x = 0 or 2; 8 ) has been obtained by using solvothermal route in
      acetonitrile, and possesses a cubic configuration with niobium centers at each
      node, linked through 12 mu 2 -O groups. The formation of the niobium oxo clusters
      has been characterized by infrared and liquid 1 H NMR spectroscopy in order to
      analyze the esterification reaction, which induce the release of water molecule, 
      which further reacts through oxolation process with niobium atoms, in different
      {Nb 2 O}, {Nb 4 O 4 } and {Nb 8 O 12 } nuclearities.

      goats.
PG  - 528
LID - 10.1186/s12864-022-08765-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adaptive thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue (BAT) is important to 
      the maintenance of temperature in newborn mammals. Cold exposure activates gene
      expression and lipid metabolism to provide energy for BAT thermogenesis. However,
      knowledge of BAT metabolism in large animals after cold exposure is still
      limited. RESULTS: In this study, we found that cold exposure induced expression
      of BAT thermogenesis genes and increased the protein levels of UCP1 and
      PGC1alpha. Pathway analysis showed that cold exposure activated BAT metabolism,
      which involved in cGMP-PKG, TCA cycle, fatty acid elongation, and degradation
      pathways. These were accompanied by decreased triglyceride (TG) content and
      increased phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content in
      BAT. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that cold exposure induces metabolites
      involved in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids metabolism in BAT. The present
      study provides evidence for lipid composition associated with adaptive
      thermogenesis in goat BAT and metabolism pathways regulated by cold exposure.

PG  - 12452
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15400-6 [doi]
AB  - To examine whether machine learning (ML) approach can be used to predict hematoma
      expansion in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with accuracy and widespread
      applicability, we applied ML algorithms to multicenter clinical data and CT
      findings on admission. Patients with acute ICH from three hospitals (n = 351) and
      those from another hospital (n = 71) were retrospectively assigned to the
      development and validation cohorts, respectively. To develop ML predictive
      models, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, logistic regression, support
      vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and XGBoost were applied to the patient
      data in the development cohort. The models were evaluated for their performance
      on the patient data in the validation cohort, which was compared with previous
      scoring methods, the BAT, BRAIN, and 9-point scores. The k-NN algorithm achieved 
      the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.790
      among all ML models, and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 0.846,
      0.733, and 0.775, respectively. The BRAIN score achieved the highest AUC of 0.676
      among all previous scoring methods, which was lower than the k-NN algorithm (p = 
      0.016). We developed and validated ML predictive models of hematoma expansion in 
      acute ICH. The models demonstrated good predictive ability, showing better
      performance than the previous scoring methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cyclin C (CCNC) is the most conserved subunit of the Mediator complex,
      which is an important transcription cofactor. Recently, we have found that CCNC
      facilitates brown adipogenesis in vitro by activating C/EBPalpha-dependent
      transcription. However, the role of CCNC in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in vivo
      remains unclear. METHODS: We generated conditional knock-out mice by crossing
      Ccnc(flox/flox) mice with Myf5(Cre), Ucp1(Cre) or Adipoq(Cre) transgenic mice to 
      investigate the role of CCNC in BAT development and function. We applied glucose 
      and insulin tolerance test, cold exposure and indirect calorimetry to capture the
      physiological phenotypes and used immunostaining, immunoblotting, qRT-PCR,
      RNA-seq and cell culture to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Here,
      we show that deletion of CCNC in Myf5(+) progenitor cells caused BAT paucity,
      despite the fact that there was significant neonatal lethality. Mechanistically
      different from in vitro, CCNC deficiency impaired the proliferation of embryonic 
      brown fat progenitor cells without affecting brown adipogenesis or cell death.
      Interestingly, CCNC deficiency robustly reduced age-dependent lipid accumulation 
      in differentiated brown adipocytes in all three mouse models. Mechanistically,
      CCNC in brown adipocytes is required for lipogenic gene expression through the
      activation of the C/EBPalpha/GLUT4/ChREBP axis. Consistent with the importance of
      de novo lipogenesis under carbohydrate-rich diets, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding
      abolished CCNC deficiency -caused defects of lipid accumulation in BAT. Although 
      insulin sensitivity and response to acute cold exposure were not affected, CCNC
      deficiency in Ucp1(+) cells enhanced the browning of white adipose tissue
      (beiging) upon prolonged cold exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data
      indicate an important role of CCNC-Mediator in the regulation of BAT development 
      and lipid accumulation in brown adipocytes.

TI  - Persistent Reptarenavirus and Hartmanivirus Infection in Cultured Boid Cells.
PG  - e0158522
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01585-22 [doi]
AB  - Mammarenaviruses establish a persistent infection in their rodent and bat hosts, 
      and the evidence suggests that reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses found in
      captive snakes act similarly. In snakes, reptarenaviruses cause boid inclusion
      body disease (BIBD), which is often associated with secondary infections. Snakes 
      with BIBD usually carry more than a single pair of reptarenavirus S and L
      segments and occasionally demonstrate hartmanivirus coinfection. Here, we
      reported the generation of cell lines persistently infected with a single or two 
      reptarenavirus(es) and a cell line with persistent reptarenavirus-hartmanivirus
      coinfection. By RT-PCR we demonstrated that the amount of viral RNA within the
      persistently infected cells remains at levels similar to those observed following
      initial infection. Using antibodies against the glycoproteins (GPs) and
      nucleoprotein (NP) of reptarenaviruses, we studied the levels of viral protein in
      cells passaged 10 times after the original inoculation and observed that the
      expression of GPs declines dramatically during persistent infection, unlike the
      expression of NP. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining served to demonstrate
      differences in the distribution of NP within the persistently infected compared
      to freshly infected cells. IF staining of cells inoculated with the viruses
      secreted from the persistently infected cell lines produced similar NP staining
      compared to cells infected with a traditionally passaged virus, suggesting that
      the altered NP expression pattern of persistently infected cells does not relate 
      to changes in the virus. The cell cultures described herein can serve as tools
      for studying the coinfection and superinfection interplay between
      reptarenaviruses and studying the BIBD pathogenesis mechanisms. IMPORTANCE
      Mammarenaviruses cause a persistent infection in their natural rodent and bat
      hosts. Reptarenaviruses cause boid inclusion body disease (BIBD) in constrictor
      snakes, but it is unclear whether snakes are the natural host of these viruses.
      In this study, we showed that reptarenaviruses established a persistent infection
      in cultured Boa constrictor cells and that the persistently infected cells
      continued to produce infectious virus. Our results showed that persistent
      infection results from subsequent passaging of cells inoculated with a single
      reptarenavirus, two reptarenaviruses, or even when inoculating the cells with
      reptarenavirus and hartmanivirus (another arenavirus genus). The results further 
      suggested that coinfection would not result in overt competition between the
      different reptarenaviruses, thus helping to explain the frequent reptarenavirus
      coinfections in snakes with BIBD. The established cell culture models of
      persistent infection could help to elucidate the role of coinfection and
      superinfection and potential immunosuppression as the pathogenic mechanisms
      behind BIBD.

TI  - A Multitrait Locus Regulates Sarbecovirus Pathogenesis.
PG  - e0145422
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01454-22 [doi]
AB  - Infectious diseases have shaped the human population genetic structure, and
      genetic variation influences the susceptibility to many viral diseases. However, 
      a variety of challenges have made the implementation of traditional human
      Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) approaches to study these infectious
      outcomes challenging. In contrast, mouse models of infectious diseases provide an
      experimental control and precision, which facilitates analyses and mechanistic
      studies of the role of genetic variation on infection. Here we use a genetic
      mapping cross between two distinct Collaborative Cross mouse strains with respect
      to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) disease outcomes. We 
      find several loci control differential disease outcome for a variety of traits in
      the context of SARS-CoV infection. Importantly, we identify a locus on mouse
      chromosome 9 that shows conserved synteny with a human GWAS locus for SARS-CoV-2 
      severe disease. We follow-up and confirm a role for this locus, and identify two 
      candidate genes, CCR9 and CXCR6, that both play a key role in regulating the
      severity of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and a distantly related bat sarbecovirus
      disease outcomes. As such we provide a template for using experimental mouse
      crosses to identify and characterize multitrait loci that regulate pathogenic
      infectious outcomes across species. IMPORTANCE Host genetic variation is an
      important determinant that predicts disease outcomes following infection. In the 
      setting of highly pathogenic coronavirus infections genetic determinants
      underlying host susceptibility and mortality remain unclear. To elucidate the
      role of host genetic variation on sarbecovirus pathogenesis and disease outcomes,
      we utilized the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse genetic reference population as a 
      model to identify susceptibility alleles to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.
      Our findings reveal that a multitrait loci found in chromosome 9 is an important 
      regulator of sarbecovirus pathogenesis in mice. Within this locus, we identified 
      and validated CCR9 and CXCR6 as important regulators of host disease outcomes.
      Specifically, both CCR9 and CXCR6 are protective against severe SARS-CoV,
      SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-related HKU3 virus disease in mice. This chromosome 9
      multitrait locus may be important to help identify genes that regulate
      coronavirus disease outcomes in humans.

TI  - Species-Specific Molecular Barriers to SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Bat Cells.
PG  - e0060822
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00608-22 [doi]
AB  - Bats are natural reservoirs of numerous coronaviruses, including the potential
      ancestor of SARS-CoV-2. Knowledge concerning the interaction between
      coronaviruses and bat cells is sparse. We investigated the ability of primary
      cells from Rhinolophus and Myotis species, as well as of established and novel
      cell lines from Myotis myotis, Eptesicus serotinus, Tadarida brasiliensis, and
      Nyctalus noctula, to support SARS-CoV-2 replication. None of these cells were
      permissive to infection, not even the ones expressing detectable levels of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as the viral receptor in
      many mammalian species. The resistance to infection was overcome by expression of
      human ACE2 (hACE2) in three cell lines, suggesting that the restriction to viral 
      replication was due to a low expression of bat ACE2 (bACE2) or the absence of
      bACE2 binding in these cells. Infectious virions were produced but not released
      from hACE2-transduced M. myotis brain cells. E. serotinus brain cells and M.
      myotis nasal epithelial cells expressing hACE2 efficiently controlled viral
      replication, which correlated with a potent interferon response. Our data
      highlight the existence of species-specific and cell-specific molecular barriers 
      to viral replication in bat cells. These novel chiropteran cellular models are
      valuable tools to investigate the evolutionary relationships between bats and
      coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Bats are host ancestors of several viruses that cause
      serious disease in humans, as illustrated by the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
      Progress in investigating bat-virus interactions has been hampered by a limited
      number of available bat cellular models. We have generated primary cells and cell
      lines from several bat species that are relevant for coronavirus research. The
      various permissivities of the cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection offered the
      opportunity to uncover some species-specific molecular restrictions to viral
      replication. All bat cells exhibited a potent entry-dependent restriction. Once
      this block was overcome by overexpression of human ACE2, which serves at the
      viral receptor, two bat cell lines controlled well viral replication, which
      correlated with the inability of the virus to counteract antiviral responses.
      Other cells potently inhibited viral release. Our novel bat cellular models
      contribute to a better understanding of the molecular interplays between bat
      cells and viruses.

TI  - Cooling-activated dorsomedial hypothalamic BDNF neurons control cold defense in
      mice.
LID - 10.1111/jnc.15666 [doi]
AB  - BDNF and its expressing neurons in the brain critically control feeding and
      energy expenditure (EE) in both rodents and humans. However, whether BDNF neurons
      would function in thermoregulation during temperature challenges is unclear.
      Here, we show that BDNF neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH(BDNF) ) of
      mice are activated by afferent cooling signals. These cooling-activated BDNF
      neurons are mainly GABAergic. Activation of DMH(BDNF) neurons or the GABAergic
      subpopulations is sufficient to increase body temperature, EE, and physical
      activity. Conversely, blocking DMH(BDNF) neurons substantially impairs cold
      defense and reduces energy expenditure, physical activity, and UCP1 expression in
      BAT, which eventually results in bodyweight gain and glucose/insulin intolerance.
      Therefore, we identify a subset of DMH(BDNF) neurons as a novel type of
      cooling-activated neurons to promote cold defense. Thus, we reveal a critical
      role of BDNF circuitry in thermoregulation, which deepens our understanding of
      BDNF in controlling energy homeostasis and obesity.

TI  - Microbial community associated with the crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum 
      L. (DC.) living on oceanic seashore: A large source of diversity revealed by
      using multiple isolation methods.
LID - 10.1111/1758-2229.13105 [doi]
AB  - Recently, the study of the interactions within a microcosm between hosts and
      their associated microbial communities drew an unprecedented interest arising
      from the holobiont concept. Lichens, a symbiotic association between a fungus and
      an alga, are redefined as complex ecosystems considering the tremendous array of 
      associated microorganisms that satisfy this concept. The present study focuses on
      the diversity of the microbiota associated with the seashore located lichen
      Rhizocarpon geographicum, recovered by different culture-dependent methods.
      Samples harvested from two sites allowed the isolation and the molecular
      identification of 68 fungal isolates distributed in 43 phylogenetic groups, 15
      bacterial isolates distributed in five taxonomic groups and three microalgae
      belonging to two species. Moreover, for 12 fungal isolates belonging to 10
      different taxa, the genus was not described in GenBank. These fungal species have
      never been sequenced or described and therefore non-studied. All these findings
      highlight the novel and high diversity of the microflora associated with R.
      geographicum. While many species disappear every day, this work suggests that
      coastal and wild environments still contain an unrevealed variety to offer and
      that lichens constitute a great reservoir of new microbial taxa which can be
      recovered by multiplying the culture-dependent techniques.

TI  - Omalizumab versus cyclosporin-A for the treatment of chronic spontaneous
      urticaria: can we define better-responding endotypes?
LID - S0365-0596(22)00138-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.abd.2022.03.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) is characterized by recurrent
      wheals and/or angioedema for longer than 6-weeks. Guidelines recommend Omalizumab
      (Oma) as first-line and Cyclosporine-A (Cs-A) as second-line treatment in
      antihistamine resistant CSU. This step-wise algorithm might be time-consuming and
      costly. OBJECTIVE: To determine indicators of response to Oma or Cs-A in CSU
      patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from seven centers in Turkey;
      the inclusion criteria for patients were to receive both Oma and Cs-A treatment
      (not concurrently) at some point in time during their follow-up. Clinical and
      laboratory features were compared between groups. RESULTS: Among 110 CSU
      patients; 47 (42.7%) were Oma-responders, 15 (13.6%) were Cs-A-responders, and 24
      (21.8%) were both Oma and Cs-A responders and 24 (21.8%) were non-responders to
      either drug. High CRP levels were more frequent in Cs-A-responders (72.7% vs.
      40.3%; p = 0.055). Oma-responders had higher baseline UCT (Urticaria Control
      Test) scores (6 vs. 4.5; p = 0.045). Responders to both drugs had less angioedema
      and higher baseline UCT scores compared to other groups (33.3% vs. 62.8%; p =
      0.01 and 8 vs. 5; p = 0.017). Non-responders to both drugs had an increased
      frequency in the female gender and lower baseline UCT scores compared to other
      groups (87.5% vs. 61.6%; p = 0.017 and 5 vs. 7; p = 0.06). STUDY LIMITATIONS:
      Retrospective nature, limited number of patients, no control group, the lack of
      the basophil activation (BAT) or BHRA (basophil histamine release assay) tests.
      CONCLUSIONS: Baseline disease activity assessment, which considers the presence
      of angioedema and disease activity scores, gender, and CRP levels might be
      helpful to predict treatment outcomes in CSU patients and to choose the right
      treatment for each patient. Categorizing patients into particular endotypes could
      provide treatment optimization and increase treatment success.

TI  - Initial investigation of associations between feeding practices, eating
      behaviours, and weight status in Vietnamese children using modified
      questionnaires.

LID - 10.1016/j.orcp.2022.07.002 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This cross-sectional study aims to extend the preliminary validation of the
      Feeding Practices and Structure Questionnaire (FPSQ) and Children's Eating
      Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) in the Vietnamese context by examining
      associations between maternal feeding practices, child eating behaviours, and
      child weight status. METHODS: Modified versions of the FPSQ and CEBQ were used to
      measure maternal feeding practices and child eating behaviours, respectively, in 
      a sample of Vietnamese mothers of children within the age range of two to five
      years (n = 100). Children's weight-for-height z-scores (WHZs) were calculated
      using weight and height measurements obtained by clinicians. Pearson's
      correlation coefficients were used to examine bivariate associations between
      maternal feeding practices, child eating behaviours, and child WHZs. Significant 
      variables were then entered into a multivariable regression model. RESULTS: Child
      WHZs were associated with maternal persuasive feeding, and child slowness in
      eating, enjoyment of food/food responsiveness, and emotional undereating, but in 
      multivariable regression analysis, only persuasive feeding (beta = -0.44, p =
      0.027) and slowness in eating (beta = -0.39, p = 0.036) contributed significantly
      to the model. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide some evidence of construct
      validity for the modified questionnaires. Potential implications of
      dietary-related behaviours on weight status in preschool-aged children in Viet
      Nam are evident. However, further validation and analysis in larger datasets must
      be undertaken in order to examine these associations with increased certainty.

TI  - COVID vaccination can be performed in patients with a history of allergic
      reactions to the vaccines or their components: experience from a specialist
      clinic in South Australia.
LID - 10.1111/imj.15888 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV2 has been a key public
      health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, since their introduction,
      there have been reports of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines in individuals with
      history of allergic reactions to other vaccines, excipients or to COVID vaccines.
      AIM: A dedicated adult COVID vaccine allergy clinic with a standardised allergy
      testing protocol was set up to investigate safety and suitability of available
      COVID vaccines in Australia. METHODS: Patients referred to a state-wide COVID-19 
      vaccine allergy clinic between March and August 2021 with a history of allergy
      underwent skin-prick testing and intradermal testing to both available vaccine
      formulations (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-S), excipients (polyethylene glycol and
      polysorbate 80), excipient-containing medications and controls. Basophil
      activation testing was conducted in few subjects with convincing history of
      immediate type reactions. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients underwent testing for
      possible excipient allergy (n = 19), previous non-COVID vaccine reaction (n = 13)
      or previous reaction to dose 1 of COVID-19 vaccine (n = 21). Patients were
      predominantly female (n = 43, 81%), aged 18-83 (median 54) years. Forty-four
      patients tested negative and 42 of these received at least their first dose of a 
      COVID-19 vaccine. Nine patients tested positive to excipients or
      excipient-containing medication only (n = 3), or vaccines (n = 6). Five patients 
      were positive to just BNT162b2, 3/5 have been vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S. One who 
      was skin test positive to both vaccines, but negative BAT to ChAdOx1-S was
      successfully vaccinated with ChAdOx1-S. CONCLUSION: Even in a high-risk
      population, most patients can be vaccinated with available COVID-19 vaccines.
      This paper reports local experiences using a combined allergy testing protocol
      with skin testing and BAT during the pandemic.

TI  - Differential Immunometabolic Effects of High-Fat Diets Containing Coconut,
      Sunflower, and Extra Virgin Olive Oils in Female Mice.
PG  - e2200082
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.202200082 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: To compare the effects of three high-fat diets (HFDs) based on coconut,
      sunflower, or extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) on adipose tissue, metabolism, and 
      inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice are fed for 16 weeks on their respective 
      HFD. HFD based on coconut oil produces significantly lower body weight than EVOO-
      or sunflower oil-based HFDs. Furthermore, the coconut oil HFD leads to metabolic 
      disturbances such as reduction of circulating leptin and adiponectin
      concentrations, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatomegaly, and liver triglyceride
      accumulation. Likewise, this diet produces an increase in serum pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]). In 
      white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissue, the HFD based on coconut oil does not
      cause significant changes in the expression of studied proteins related to
      thermogenesis (uncoupling protein 1 [UCP-1]), mitochondrial biogenesis, and
      browning (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha
      [PGC-1alpha] and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 [Nrf2]). However, the HFD
      based on EVOO induces upregulation of UCP-1, PGC-1alpha, and Nrf2 expression in
      BAT, increases the expression of UCP-1 and PGC-1alpha in inguinal WAT, and
      enhances the expression of PGC-1alpha in epididymal WAT. CONCLUSIONS: An HFD
      based on coconut oil could reduce circulating leptin and adiponectin
      concentrations, increase the liver fat content, raise serum triglycerides, and
      promote inflammation by increasing circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, while 
      an EVOO-based HFD could increase thermogenic activity.

AB  - Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have revolutionized anemia treatment in 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but ESA resistance is increasingly identified.
      Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) is one cause of ESA resistance. We describe a
      patient with ESA-resistant, transfusion-dependent anemia and mild SHP with
      remodeling and reticulin fibrosis on bone marrow biopsy, all of which resolved
      with stricter SHP management. We identified 64 patients with anemia, ESRD, and
      bone marrow biopsy. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) range for bony remodeling was
      183-16,161.9 pg/ml versus 90.8-3283 pg/ml. The PTH range for fibrotic changes was
      183-2487 pg/ml versus 90.8-16,161.9 pg/ml. We found no clear PTH range predictive
      for bone marrow changes.

TI  - Emergence activity at hibernacula differs among four bat species affected by
      white-nose syndrome.
PG  - e9113
LID - 10.1002/ece3.9113 [doi]
AB  - Prior to the introduction of white-nose syndrome (WNS) to North America,
      temperate bats were thought to remain within hibernacula throughout most of the
      winter. However, recent research has shown that bats in the southeastern United
      States emerge regularly from hibernation and are active on the landscape,
      regardless of their WNS status. The relationship between winter activity and
      susceptibility to WNS has yet to be explored but warrants attention, as it may
      enable managers to implement targeted management for WNS-affected species. We
      investigated this relationship by implanting 1346 passive integrated transponder 
      (PIT) tags in four species that vary in their susceptibility to WNS. Based on
      PIT-tag detections, three species entered hibernation from late October to early 
      November. Bats were active at hibernacula entrances on days when midpoint
      temperatures ranged from -1.94 to 22.78 degrees C (mean midpoint temperature =
      8.70 +/- 0.33 degrees C). Eastern small-footed bats (Myotis leibii), a species
      with low susceptibility to WNS, were active throughout winter, with a significant
      decrease in activity in mid-hibernation (December 16 to February 15). Tricolored 
      bats (Perimyotis subflavus), a species that is highly susceptible to WNS,
      exhibited an increase in activity beginning in mid-hibernation and extending
      through late hibernation (February 16 to March 31). Indiana bats (M. sodalis), a 
      species determined to have a medium-high susceptibility to WNS, remained on the
      landscape into early hibernation (November 1 to December 15), after which we did 
      not record any again until the latter portion of mid-hibernation. Finally, gray
      bats (M. grisescens), another species with low susceptibility to WNS, maintained 
      low but regular levels of activity throughout winter. Given these results, we
      determined that emergence activity from hibernacula during winter is highly
      variable among bat species and our data will assist wildlife managers to make
      informed decisions regarding the timing of implementation of species-specific
      conservation actions.

AB  - Objective: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates chemical energy to protect
      against obesity. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effects of
      Erchen decoction on the lipolysis and thermogenesis function of BAT in high-fat
      diet-fed rats. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four
      groups, which were fed a control diet (C) or a high-fat diet (HF), and the latter
      was administered with high and low doses of Erchen decoction by gavage once a
      day, for 12 weeks. Body weight, the serum lipid profile, serum glucose, and
      insulin levels of the rats were evaluated. In addition, the phosphorylation and
      protein and mRNA expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), adipose
      triglyceride lipase (ATGL), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
      coactivator- (PGC-) 1alpha, and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) in BAT were measured
      by immunoblotting and RT-PCR. Results: Erchen decoction administration decreased 
      body weight gain and ameliorated the abnormal lipid profile and insulin
      resistance index of the high-fat diet-fed rats. In addition, the expression of
      p-AMPK and ATGL in the BAT was significantly increased by Erchen decoction.
      Erchen decoction also increased the protein and mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha and
      UCP-1 in BAT. Conclusion: Erchen decoction ameliorates the metabolic
      abnormalities of high-fat diet-fed rats, at least in part via activation of
      lipolysis and thermogenesis in BAT.

TI  - Effects of robotic priming of bilateral arm training, mirror therapy, and
      impairment-oriented training on sensorimotor and daily functions in patients with
      chronic stroke: study protocol of a single-blind, randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 566
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06498-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combining robotic therapy (RT) with task-oriented therapy is an
      emerging strategy to facilitate motor relearning in stroke rehabilitation. This
      study protocol will compare novel rehabilitation regimens that use bilateral RT
      as a priming technique to augment two task-oriented therapies: mirror therapy
      (MT) and bilateral arm training (BAT) with a control intervention: RT combined
      with impairment-oriented training (IOT). METHODS: This single-blind, randomized, 
      comparative efficacy study will involve 96 participants with chronic stroke.
      Participants will be randomized into bilateral RT+MT, bilateral RT+BAT, and
      bilateral RT+IOT groups and receive 18 intervention sessions (90 min/day, 3
      d/week for 6 weeks). The outcomes will include the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Stroke 
      Impact Scale version 3.0, Medical Research Council scale, Revised Nottingham
      Sensory Assessment, ABILHAND Questionnaire, and accelerometer and will be
      assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at the 3-month follow-up. Analysis of 
      covariance and the chi-square automatic interaction detector method will be used 
      to examine the comparative efficacy and predictors of outcome, respectively,
      after bilateral RT+MT, bilateral RT+BAT, and bilateral RT+IOT. DISCUSSION: The
      findings are expected to contribute to the research and development of robotic
      devices, to update the evidence-based protocols in postacute stroke care
      programs, and to investigate the use of accelerometers for monitoring activity
      level in real-life situations, which may in turn promote home-based practice by
      the patients and their caregivers. Directions for further studies and empirical
      implications for clinical practice will be further discussed in upper-extremity
      rehabilitation after stroke. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered
      December 12, 2018, at www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov ( NCT03773653 ).

AB  - Rabies infects all mammals; however, transmission cycles are only maintained in
      certain bat and carnivore species. The high incidence of rabies in Greater Kudu
      (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) observed in Namibia for over 40 years has led to
      postulation that independent virus transmission is occurring within this antelope
      population. We have analysed extensive experimental, epidemiological,
      phylogeographic and deep sequence data, which collectively refute maintenance of 
      an independent rabies cycle in kudu. As rabies in kudu continues to have a
      negative impact on the Namibian agricultural sector, measures to protect kudu
      have been investigated, including the use of a third-generation oral rabies
      vaccine. Initial results show protection of kudu from rabies infection via the
      oral route, with an appropriate bait design, different application schedules and 
      vaccination doses further enhancing the immune response. Rabies in kudu is a
      complex interplay at the wildlife-livestock interface and requires a concerted
      approach to successfully control.

TI  - Maternal L-carnitine supplementation promotes brown adipose tissue thermogenesis 
      of newborn goats after cold exposure.
PG  - e22461
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200637R [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important component of energy expenditure and
      necessary to maintain body temperature for newborn mammals. In the previous
      study, we found that L-carnitine was enriched in BAT and promoted BAT
      adipogenesis and thermogenesis in goat brown adipocytes. However, whether dietary
      L-carnitine regulates BAT heat production and energy expenditure in lambs remains
      unclear. In this study, maternal L-carnitine supplementation elevated the rectal 
      temperature, as well as the expression of UCP1 and mitochondrial DNA content to
      promote BAT thermogenesis in newborn goats. Moreover, maternal L-carnitine
      supplementation increased the levels of triglycerides (TG), non-esterified fatty 
      acids (NEFA), and lactate in plasma, as well as the content of lipid droplet and 
      glycogen in BAT of newborn goats. Lipidomic analysis showed that maternal
      L-carnitine supplementation remodeled the lipid composition of BAT in newborn
      goats. L-carnitine significantly increased the levels of TG and diglyceride (DG) 
      and decreased the levels of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in BAT.
      Further studies showed that L-carnitine promoted TG and glycogen deposition in
      brown adipocytes through AMPKalpha. Our results indicate that maternal
      L-carnitine supplementation promotes BAT development and thermogenesis in newborn
      goats and provides new evidence for newborn goats to maintain body temperature in
      response to cold exposure.

TI  - Cluster-Geometry-Associated Metal-Metal Bonding in Trimetallic Carbide
      Clusterfullerenes.
PG  - 11277-11283
LID - 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.2c01399 [doi]
AB  - Geometry configurations of the metallic clusters play a significant role in the
      involved bonding nature. Herein, we report the crystallographic characterization 
      of unprecedented erbium-based trimetallic clusterfullerenes, namely,
      Er3C2@Ih(7)-C80, in which the inner Er3C2 cluster presents a lifted bat ray
      configuration with the C2 unit elevated by approximately 1.62 A above the Er3
      plane. Within the plane, the Er...Er distances for Er1...Er2, Er1...Er2A, and
      Er2...Er2A are 3.4051(15), 3.4051(15), and 3.3178(15) A, respectively, falling
      into the range of the metal-metal bonding. Density functional theory calculations
      unveil the three-center-one-electron Er-Er-Er bond in Er3C2@Ih(7)-C80 with one
      electron shared by three metals, and thus, its exceptional electronic structure
      can be expressed as (Er3)(8+)(C2)(2-)@C80(6-). Interestingly, with the further
      observation on the geometry configurations of the encapsulated clusters in
      M3C2@C2n (M = Sc, Y, and Lu) series, we find that the lifted bat ray
      configuration of the inner cluster is explicitly associated with the formation of
      the bonding interactions between the inner metals. This finding provides insights
      into the nature of metal-metal bonding and gives guidelines for the design of the
      single-molecule magnet.

TI  - Effect of Acute Cold Exposure on Energy Metabolism and Activity of Brown Adipose 
      Tissue in Humans: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 917084
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.917084 [doi]
AB  - Background: The benefit of cold exposure for humans against obesity has brought
      the energy metabolism and activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) induced by cold 
      into focus. But the results are inconsistent. This review is aimed to
      systematically explore the effect of cold exposure on the activity of BAT and
      energy metabolism in humans. Methods: We searched relevant papers that were
      published from 1990 to 2021 and were cited in PubMed Central, Web of science,
      Embase and Cochrane Library databases to conduct this systematic review and
      meta-analysis. Energy metabolism, BAT volume, BAT activity and non-esterified
      fatty acids (NEFA) data reported in eligible researches were extracted.
      Meta-analysis was applied to combine the mean difference or standard mean
      difference with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RevMan 5.3 software was
      used for meta-analysis and evaluating the risk of bias. Stata 16.0 was used for
      evaluating the publication bias. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials were
      included in meta-analysis. Compared with human exposed in room temperature at 24 
      degrees C, the energy expenditure (EE) was increased after acute cold exposure at
      16 approximately 19 degrees C (Z = 7.58, p < 0.05, mean different = 188.43kal/d, 
      95% CI = 139.73-237.13); BAT volume (Z = 2.62, p < 0.05; standard mean different 
      = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.10-0.73); BAT activity (Z = 2.05, p = 0.04, standard mean
      difference = 1.61, 95% CI = 0.07-3.14) and the intake of BAT NEFA (Z = 2.85, p < 
      0.05; standard mean different = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.17-0.90) also increased.
      Conclusion: Acute cold exposure could improve the energy expenditure and BAT
      activity in adults, which is beneficial for human against obesity.

LID - 10.3897/zookeys.1094.62644 [doi]
AB  - The faunistic knowledge of the Diptera of Morocco recorded from 1787 to 2021 is
      summarized and updated in this first catalogue of Moroccan Diptera species. A
      total of 3057 species, classified into 948 genera and 93 families (21 Nematocera 
      and 72 Brachycera), are listed. Taxa (superfamily, family, genus and species)
      have been updated according to current interpretations, based on reviews in the
      literature, the expertise of authors and contributors, and recently conducted
      fieldwork. Data to compile this catalogue were primarily gathered from the
      literature. In total, 1225 references were consulted and some information was
      also obtained from online databases. Each family was reviewed and the checklist
      updated by the respective taxon expert(s), including the number of species that
      can be expected for that family in Morocco. For each valid species, synonyms
      known to have been used for published records from Morocco are listed under the
      currently accepted name. Where available, distribution within Morocco is also
      included. One new combination is proposed: Assuaniamelanoleuca (Seguy, 1941),
      comb. nov. (Chloropidae).

AB  - Maternal obesity may compromise the micronutrient status of the offspring.
      Vitamin A (VA) is an essential micronutrient during neonatal development. Its
      active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), is a key regulator of VA homeostasis,
      which also regulates adipose tissue (AT) development in obese adults. However,
      its role on VA status and AT metabolism in neonates was unknown and it was
      determined in the present study. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised to 
      a normal fat diet (NFD) or a high fat diet (HFD). From postnatal day 5 (P5) to
      P20, half of the HFD pups received oral RA every 3 d (HFDRA group). NFD pups and 
      the remaining HFD pups (HFD group) received placebo. Six hours after dosing on
      P8, P14 and P20, n 4 pups per group were euthanised for different measures. It
      was found that total retinol concentration in neonatal liver and lung was
      significantly lower in the HFD group than the NFD group, while the concentrations
      were significantly increased in the HFDRA group. The HFD group exhibited
      significantly higher body weight (BW) gain, AT mass, serum leptin and
      adiponectin, and gene expression of these adipokines in white adipose tissue
      compared with the NFD group; these measures were significantly reduced in the
      HFDRA group. BAT UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression were significantly higher in pups 
      receiving RA. In conclusion, repeated RA treatment during the suckling period
      improved the tissue VA status of neonates exposed to maternal obesity. RA also
      exerted a regulatory effect on neonatal obesity development by reducing BW gain
      and adiposity and modulating AT metabolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Brown adipogenesis and thermogenesis in brown and beige adipose tissue
      (AT) involve vascular remodeling and sympathetic neuronal guidance. Here, we
      investigated the molecular mechanism coordinating these processes. METHODS: We
      used mouse models to identify the molecular target of a peptide CPATAERPC homing 
      to the endothelium of brown and beige AT. RESULTS: We demonstrate that CPATAERPC 
      mimics nerve growth factor (NGF) and identify a low molecular weight isoform of
      NGF receptor, TrkA, as the CPATAERPC cell surface target. We show that the
      expression of truncated endothelial TrkA is selective for brown and subcutaneous 
      AT. Analysis of mice with endothelium-specific TrkA knockout revealed the role of
      TrkA in neuro-vascular coordination supporting the thermogenic function of brown 
      adipocytes. A hunter-killer peptide D-BAT, composed of CPATAERPC and a
      pro-apoptotic domain, induced cell death in the endothelium and adipocytes. This 
      resulted in thermogenesis impairment, and predisposed mice to obesity and glucose
      intolerance. We also tested if this treatment can inhibit the tumor recruitment
      of lipids mobilized from adipocytes from adjacent AT. Indeed, in a mouse model of
      breast cancer D-BAT suppressed tumor-associated AT lipolysis, which resulted in
      reduced fatty acid utilization by cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our study
      demonstrates that TrkA signaling in the endothelium supports neuro-vascular
      coordination enabling beige adipogenesis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bat cell cultures are a popular model both for the isolation of
      vector-borne disease viruses and for assessing the possible role of these
      mammalian species in forming the natural reservoirs of arbovirus infection
      vectors. The goal of the research was to obtain and characterize strains of
      diploid lung cells of the bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and evaluate their
      permissivity to bluetongue, African horse sickness (AHS), and epizootic
      hemorrhagic disease of deer (EHD) viruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell cultures
      of the dwarf bat's lung were obtained by standard enzymatic disaggregation of
      donor tissue and selection of cells for adhesive properties. The permissivity of 
      cell cultures was determined to bluetongue, AHL, and EHD orbiviruses. RESULTS:
      Diploid cell strains (epithelium-like and fibroblast-like types) retaining
      cytomorphological characteristics and karyotype stability were obtained from
      tissue of the bat's lung. Their permissivity to viruses of the genus Orbivirus of
      the Reoviridae family, pathogens of transmissible animal diseases, has been
      established. DISCUSSION: The permissivity of the obtained strains of bat's lung
      cells to bluetongue, AHL, and EHD viruses is consistent with the isolation of
      orbiviruses in bats of the species Pteropus poliocephalus, Pteropus hypomelanus, 
      Rousettus aegyptiacus leachii, Syconycteris crassa, Myotis macrodactylus, and
      Eidolon helvum. CONCLUSION: Strains of diploid lung cells of the dwarf bat are
      permissive to orbiviruses of bluetongue, AHS, and EHD, which allows us to
      recommend them for the isolation of these viruses, and the species Pipistrellus
      pipistrellus to be considered as a potential natural reservoir and carrier of
      pathogens of these vector-borne diseases.

TI  - Management of patients with elevated Self-BAT scores or other bleeding symptoms: 
      Updated overview for primary care practitioners.
PG  - 494-499
LID - 10.46747/cfp.6807494 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations for management of patients presenting with 
      elevated self-administered bleeding assessment tool (Self-BAT) scores or other
      bleeding symptoms in a primary care setting. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Primary
      research sources, clinical review articles, and interviews with research staff,
      hematologists, and family physicians were used to create the poster tools and
      reference guide resources. MAIN MESSAGE: Recommendations to manage a patient with
      an elevated Self-BAT score or other bleeding symptoms include reviewing the
      results of the Self-BAT to clarify relevant symptoms, performing initial
      diagnostic laboratory tests, and doing basic symptom management. Clinical
      judgment should be used when determining whether referral to a hematologist is
      necessary, but referral should be considered if the bleeding score is abnormal or
      if initial management options are ineffective. Some bleeding symptoms warrant
      evaluation by a gastroenterologist, obstetrician-gynecologist, or
      otolaryngologist. CONCLUSION: Primary care providers should conduct a thorough
      review of the Self-BAT results and associated management recommendations when
      working with a patient presenting with an elevated score or other bleeding
      manifestations. A review consists of the clarification of relevant symptoms,
      appropriate initial laboratory workups, and patient education. Treatment options 
      for symptom management should be explored while recognizing the threshold for
      referral to a hematologist.

TI  - Overexpressing hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 in mouse brown adipose tissue
      restores glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice.
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00084.2022 [doi]
AB  - Interscapular BAT (iBAT) plays an important role in the control of glucose
      homeostasis. Increased glucose entry and glycolysis in iBAT result in lactate
      production and release. The adipose tissue expresses the lactate receptor
      hydrocarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) that is markedly downregulated in male
      diet-induced obese (DIO) and ob/ob mice. In this study, we examined the role of
      HCAR1 in iBAT in controlling glucose homeostasis in male DIO mice. We
      overexpressed HCAR1 in iBAT by injecting adeno-associated viruses (AAV)
      expressing HCAR1 into the iBAT pads of male DIO C57BL/6J mice. Overexpressing
      HCAR1 in iBAT resulted in augmented glucose uptake by iBAT in response to
      treatment with the HCAR1 agonist. HCAR1 overexpression elevated iBAT temperature 
      associated with increased thermogenic gene expression in iBAT. HCAR1
      overexpression prevented body weight gain in male DIO mice. Importantly, mice
      overexpressing HCAR1 in iBAT exhibited improved glucose tolerance and insulin
      sensitivity. HCAR1 overexpression upregulated the Slc2a4 gene expression and
      promoted GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane. In addition, mice
      overexpressing HCAR1 displayed a decrease in HSL phosphorylation and increased
      lipogenic enzyme gene expression in iBAT. Unlike DIO mice, overexpressing HCAR1
      in iBAT of mice fed a low-fat diet did not change body weight gain and glucose
      homeostasis. Taken together, our results support the interpretation that HCAR1
      expressed in iBAT promotes glucose entry and reduces lipolysis in iBAT of male
      DIO mice. As activation of HCAR1 in iBAT restores body weight, glucose tolerance,
      and insulin sensitivity in male DIO mice, targeting HCAR1 in iBAT would provide
      an alternative way to control body weight and euglycemia in individuals with
      obesity.

TI  - Temples and bats in a homogeneous agriculture landscape: Importance of
      microhabitat availability, disturbance and land use for bat conservation.
PG  - e0251771
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0251771 [doi]
AB  - Cave-dwelling bats widely use anthropogenic structures such as temples in south
      Asia as roosting and nursery sites. Such roosts are constantly under threat, even
      more so after the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the importance of such roosts, there
      is no detailed understanding of what makes temples favorable for bats and the
      critical factors for their persistence. Here we relate temple microhabitat
      characteristics and land use around ancient temples (>400 years) to bat species
      richness and abundance in the Tamiraparani river basin of south India. Temples
      were selected for sampling along the river basin based on logistics and
      permission to access them. We counted bats at the roost in the mornings and late 
      afternoons from inside the temples. Temple characteristics such as dark rooms,
      walkways, crevices, towers, and disturbances to the roosts were recorded. Based
      on European Space Agency land use classifications, we recorded land use such as
      crops, trees, scrub, grassland, urban areas, and water availability within a 5 km
      radius of the temple. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to relate the
      counts in temples with microhabitats and land use. We sampled 59 temples
      repeatedly across 5 years which yielded a sample of 246 survey events. The total 
      number of bats counted was 20,211, of which Hipposideros speoris was the most
      common (9,715), followed by Rousettus leschenaultii (5,306), Taphozous
      melanopogon (3,196), Megaderma lyra (1,497), Tadarida aegyptiaca (303),
      Pipistrellus sp. (144) and Rhinopoma hardwickii (50). About 39% of the total bats
      occurred in dark rooms and 51% along walkways. Species richness and total
      abundance were related to the availability of dark rooms and the number of
      buildings in the temple. Land use elements only had a weak effect, but scrub and 
      grassland, even though they were few, are critical for bats. We conclude that
      retaining undisturbed dark rooms with small exits in temples and other dimly lit 
      areas and having natural areas around temples are vital for bat conservation.

      (Acari: Argasidae) and blood of the wild mammal hosts in the Orinoquia region,
      Colombia.

AB  - Interest in research on soft ticks has increased in recent decades, leading to
      valuable insight into their role as disease vectors. The use of
      metagenomics-based analyses have helped to elucidate ecological factors involved 
      in pathogen, vector, and host dynamics. To understand the main bacterial
      assemblages present in Ornithodoros cf. hasei and its mammalian hosts, 84 ticks
      and 13 blood samples from bat hosts (Chiroptera) were selected, and the 16S rRNA 
      gene V4 region was sequenced in five pools (each one related to each host-tick
      pairing). Bacterial taxonomic assignment analyses were performed by comparing
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared between ticks and their host blood.
      This analysis showed the presence of Proteobacteria (38.8%), Enterobacteriaceae
      (25%), Firmicutes (12.3%), and Actinobacteria (10.9%) within blood samples, and
      Rickettsiaceae (39%), Firmicutes (25%), Actinobacteria (13.1%), and
      Proteobacteria (9%) within ticks. Species related to potentially pathogenic
      genera were detected in ticks, such as Borrelia sp., Bartonella tamiae, Ehrlichia
      sp. and Rickettsia-like endosymbiont, and the presence of these organisms was
      found in all analyzed bat species (Cynomops planirostris, Molossus pretiosus,
      Noctilio albiventris), and O. cf. hasei. About 41-48.6% of bacterial OTUs (genera
      and species) were shared between ticks and the blood of bat hosts. Targeted
      metagenomic screening techniques allowed the detection of tick-associated
      pathogens for O. cf. hasei and small mammals for the first time, enabling future 
      research on many of these pathogens.

AB  - The "One Health" approach is essential to better understand and manage a pandemic
      of animal origin. Sensitive geopolitical considerations seem to hamper the
      investigations into the origin of the pandemic, but everything points to the
      Rhinolophus bat as the starting point of this devastating pandemic. Through a
      phenomenon of reverse zoonosis, several hundred cases of contamination of animals
      by SARS-CoV-2 have been identified worldwide, involving about twenty species of
      mammals. The virus has also passed from animals to humans in the case of infected
      mink farms in Denmark or through contact with hamsters in Hong Kong. For the
      development of vaccines and treatments and to help detect COVID-19 in train
      stations or airports, the animal has confirmed its role as a valuable auxiliary
      resource for humans in the fight against the pandemic.

TI  - Changes in hibernating tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) roosting behavior in
      response to white-nose syndrome.
PG  - e9045

AB  - Understanding animals' behavioral and physiological responses to pathogenic
      diseases is critical for management and conservation. One such disease,
      white-nose syndrome (WNS), has greatly affected bat populations throughout
      eastern North America leading to significant population declines in several
      species. Although tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) populations have
      experienced significant declines, little research has been conducted on their
      responses to the disease, particularly in the southeastern United States. Our
      objective was to document changes in tricolored bat roost site use after the
      appearance of WNS in a hibernaculum in the southeastern U.S. and relate these to 
      microsite temperatures, ambient conditions, and population trends. We censused a 
      tricolored bat hibernaculum in northwestern South Carolina, USA, once each year
      between February 26 and March 2, 2014-2021, and recorded species, section of the 
      tunnel, distance from the entrance, and wall temperature next to each bat. The
      number of tricolored bats in the hibernaculum dropped by 90.3% during the first 3
      years after the arrival of WNS. However, numbers stabilized and slightly
      increased from 2018 to 2021. Prior to the arrival of WNS, 95.6% of tricolored
      bats roosted in the back portion of the tunnel that was the warmest. After the
      arrival of WNS, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of bats
      using the front, colder portions of the tunnel, particularly during the period of
      population stabilization and increase. Roost temperatures of bats were also
      positively associated with February external temperatures. Our results suggest
      that greater use of the colder sections of the tunnel by tricolored bats could
      have led to increased survival due to slower growth rates of the fungus that
      causes WNS in colder temperatures or decreased energetic costs associated with
      colder hibernation temperatures. Thus, management actions that provide cold
      hibernacula may be an option for long-term management of hibernacula,
      particularly in southern regions.

AB  - Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a technique that can be employed to quantify
      biological processes in living cells. When used in small animal models such as
      mice, BLI can provide both longitudinal and positional information regarding the 
      biological process under investigation. Although perhaps best known for its
      utility in non-invasively quantifying tumor burden over time in experimental
      animals, BLI has also been applied in many pathogenesis models to track pathogen 
      burden and responses to therapeutic interventions. In this chapter, we present a 
      BLI-based method for tracing anatomical progression of lyssavirus infection in a 
      mouse model. We also include validation methods to ensure that semiquantitative
      BLI data correlate well with viral load. Due to the longitudinal nature of this
      approach, lyssavirus pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention studies can be
      performed with far fewer animals than more traditional approaches, which
      typically require euthanasia of large animal groups at every data collection time
      point.

      next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we found that the ratios of the RNA
      levels of the 10 reovirus segments in infected cells were constant during the
      late stages of infection. We also discovered that the relative abundance of each 
      segment differed. Notably, the relative abundance of M2 (encoding the micro1
      protein) and S4 (encoding the sigma3 protein) RNAs was higher than that of the
      others throughout the infection. Additionally, massive junctions were identified.
      These results support the hypothesis that defective genome segments are generated
      and that cross-family recombination occurs. These data may further the study of
      gene function, viral replication, and virus evolution.

AB  - The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 carries multiple unusual mutations,
      particularly in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein.
      Moreover, host-adapting mutations, such as residues 493, 498, and 501, were also 
      observed in the Omicron RBD, which indicates that it is necessary to evaluate the
      interspecies transmission risk of the Omicron variant. Herein, we evaluated the
      interspecies recognition of the Omicron BA.1 and Delta RBDs by 27 ACE2 orthologs,
      including humans. We found that Omicron BA.1 expanded its receptor binding
      spectra to palm-civet, rodents, more bats (least horseshoe bat and greater
      horseshoe bat) and lesser hedgehog tenrec. Additionally, we determined the
      cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Omicron BA.1 S protein
      complexed with mouse ACE2 (mACE2) and the crystal structure of Omicron RBD
      complexed with palm-civet ACE2 (cvACE2). Several key residues for the host range 
      have been identified. These results suggest that surveillance should be enhanced 
      on the Omicron variant for its broader-species receptor binding to prevent
      spillover and expansion of reservoir hosts for a prolonged pandemic.

TI  - TrackUSF, a novel tool for automated ultrasonic vocalization analysis, reveals
      modified calls in a rat model of autism.
PG  - 159
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01299-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various mammalian species emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), which
      reflect their emotional state and mediate social interactions. USVs are usually
      analyzed by manual or semi-automated methodologies that categorize discrete USVs 
      according to their structure in the frequency-time domains. This laborious
      analysis hinders the effective use of USVs as a readout for high-throughput
      analysis of behavioral changes in animals. RESULTS: Here we present a novel
      automated open-source tool that utilizes a different approach towards USV
      analysis, termed TrackUSF. To validate TrackUSF, we analyzed calls from different
      animal species, namely mice, rats, and bats, recorded in various settings and
      compared the results with a manual analysis by a trained observer. We found that 
      TrackUSF detected the majority of USVs, with less than 1% of false-positive
      detections. We then employed TrackUSF to analyze social vocalizations in
      Shank3-deficient rats, a rat model of autism, and revealed that these
      vocalizations exhibit a spectrum of deviations from appetitive calls towards
      aversive calls. CONCLUSIONS: TrackUSF is a simple and easy-to-use system that may
      be used for a high-throughput comparison of ultrasonic vocalizations between
      groups of animals of any kind in any setting, with no prior assumptions.

TI  - Disentangling subjective symptom complaints and objective cognitive performance
      in veterans: Impact of posttraumatic stress disorder and lifetime traumatic brain
      injury burden.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/23279095.2022.2096452 [doi]
AB  - Self-reported histories of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are prevalent among post-9/11 veterans. Both are 
      associated with subjective and often overlapping symptom complaints, but variably
      with objective neuropsychological test performances. These outcomes are seldom
      explored in relation to lifetime mTBI burden. This cross-sectional study examined
      associations of PTSD and lifetime mTBI with subjective (persistent symptoms after
      concussion and cognitive complaints) and objective (performances across five
      cognitive domains) measures among 46 veterans. Within this sample, 20 veterans
      had Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) confirmed PTSD (PTSD+), 
      whereas 26 demographically-similar participants did not meet criteria (PTSD-).
      The Boston Assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury-Lifetime (BAT-L) yielded total
      mTBI scores ranging from 0 to 8. Regressions showed PTSD was associated with
      increased subjective symptoms/cognitive complaints, along with reduced verbal
      fluency, visuospatial memory, and processing speed performances. Lifetime mTBI
      burden was associated with subjective symptoms, but not with objective cognitive 
      test performance, after controlling for PTSD. No significant interactions were
      observed. Exploratory correlations suggested that all PTSD symptom clusters were 
      generally associated with the subjective and objective measures. However, fewer
      significant associations emerged within the PTSD+/- groups separately, with each 
      group yielding somewhat different patterns of relationships. PTSD and increasing 
      mTBI burden are consistently associated with negative subjective symptoms,
      including cognitive complaints. Each condition likely explains some degree of
      unique variance in symptom reporting. PTSD is associated with poorer objective
      cognition on some tasks, including processing speed, executive functioning, and
      learning/memory. Implications are explored.

AB  - Bats (order, Chiroptera) account for more than one-fifth of all mammalian species
      in the world and are infected by various intra-erythrocytic parasites of the
      family Plasmodiidae (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida), including Polychromophilus
      Dionisi, 1899. Recent advance in the molecular characterization of haemosporidian
      isolates has enabled their accurate identification, particularly in the last
      decade. Studies are actively conducted in tropical regions, Europe, and
      Australia; however, data on haemosporidian infection in bats in Asian temperate
      areas, including Japan, remain limited. In this study, 75 bats of 4 species
      (Miniopterus fuliginosus, Myotis macrodactylus, Rhinolophus nippon, and
      Rhinolophus cornutus) were captured at three sites in western Japan (Yamaguchi
      Prefecture), and haemosporidian parasites were screened microscopically and
      molecularly via nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cytochrome b
      (cytb), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox-1), apicoplast caseinolytic protease 
      C (clpc), and nuclear elongation factor 2 (EF2) genes. The survey detected
      Polychromophilus melanipherus in 15 (40.5%) miniopterid bats (M. fuliginosus) and
      Polychromophilus murinus in 6 (46.2%) vespertilionid bats (M. macrodactylus),
      whereas none of the 25 rhinolophid bats (R. nippon and R. cornutus) was infected,
      indicating the robust host specificity for miniopterid (P. melanipherus) and
      vespertilionid (P. murinus) bats regardless of orthotopic nesting. The 15
      Polychromophilus cytb sequences obtained from 11 miniopterid and 4 vespertilionid
      bats were classified into six cytb haplotypes (three for each species), showing
      no region-specific variation in a phylogenetic tree of Polychromophilus isolates 
      in the Old World. Similarly, multiple haplotypes (seven for cox-1 and nine for
      clpc) and genotypes (three for EF2) were characterized for the Japanese isolates 
      of Polychromophilus, and the results were consistent with those based on a
      haemosporidian cytb analysis. Bat flies (Nycteribia allotopa and another
      undetermined Nycteribia sp.) collected from the body surface of bats harbored
      Polychromophilus oocysts on the external surface of the midgut. This is the first
      study to report the isolation and molecular characterization of Polychromophilus 
      spp. in miniopterid and vespertilionid bats in the temperate area of Asia
      (western Japan). Future studies should evaluate the global prevalence of
      haemosporidian infections in bats.

LID - 10.1016/j.jacbts.2022.01.010 [doi]
AB  - Heart disease remains the leading cause of death, and mortality rates positively 
      correlate with the presence of obesity and diabetes. Despite the correlation
      between cardiac and metabolic dysregulation, the mechanistic pathway(s) of
      interorgan crosstalk still remain undefined. This study reveals that
      cardiac-restricted expression of an amino-terminal peptide of GRK2 (betaARKnt)
      preserves systemic and cardiac insulin responsiveness, and protects against
      adipocyte maladaptive hypertrophy in a diet-induced obesity model. These data
      suggest a cardiac-driven mechanism to ameliorate maladaptive cardiac remodeling
      and improve systemic metabolic homeostasis that may lead to new treatment
      modalities for cardioprotection in obesity and obesity-related metabolic
      syndromes.

AB  - Human cervical cancer oncogene (HCCR-1), also named as LETMD1, is an LETM-domain 
      containing outer mitochondrial membrane protein which plays an important role in 
      carcinogenesis. The present study found that the loss of Letmd1 in mice led to
      severe abnormities, such as brown adipose tissue (BAT) whitening, impaired
      thermogenesis of both BAT and beige fat, cold intolerance, diet-induced obesity, 
      glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Mechanically, the deletion of Letmd1 
      in BAT caused decreased level of both mitochondrial and intracellular Ca(2+). The
      reduced intracellular Ca(2+) could suppress the fission of mitochondria and
      ultimately lead to the disruption of BAT thermogenesis by regulating
      mitochondrial structures and functions. This study indicates that LETMD1 played a
      crucial role in BAT thermogenesis and energy homeostasis through regulating
      mitochondrial structures and functions, which provides a novel insight into
      therapeutic target exploration from oncogenes for metabolic disorders.

TI  - Predicting Metal Bioavailability and Risk of Toxicity in Nigerian Surface Waters:
      Are the Existing User-Friendly Bioavailability Tools Applicable?
LID - 10.1002/etc.5429 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we assessed the use of existing user-friendly
      bioavailability tools to predict metal bioavailability and the risk of toxicity
      in a typical Nigerian surface water. The effect of prevailing water chemistry on 
      toxicity of metals was also assessed in laboratory studies. Surface water samples
      were collected at four locations downstream Ogun River in Lagos State and water
      chemistry analysis was carried out using standard methods. Relevant parameters
      were inputted into the Bio-Met software and M-BAT tool that are run on Microsoft 
      excel spreadsheet to obtain site-specific HC5/PNECs for selected metals and Risk 
      characterization ratios (RCRs) at locations downstream the river. Assessments
      using the bioavailability tools showed that two locations; Owode-Onirin and Kara,
      were more sensitive to Zn and Pb inputs compared to the other locations. The RCR 
      for Cu, Zn and Pb respectively, were > 1 at all locations indicating a potential 
      risk of toxicity to aquatic life. Results from laboratory studies conformed with 
      predictions from the bioavailability tools, as Zn and Pb were more toxic to
      aquatic organisms in surface water collected from Owode-Onirin and Kara locations
      respectively, compared to toxicity in surface water from other locations. The
      issue of bioavailability in metal pollution control is widely accepted and has
      been incorporated into water quality guidelines (WQG) in the US, UK, and Europe. 
      In the absence of regulations incorporating bioavailability in developing
      countries including Nigeria, it is essential to assess the applicability of
      existing methods incorporating bioavailability, to surface waters in this region.
      Findings from such studies will facilitate the development region-specific WQG
      for metals which will be protective of locally relevant aquatic life. This

TI  - Phylogenomics and Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Bovine Leukemia Virus Focusing on
      Asian Native Cattle: Insights Into the Early Origin and Global Dissemination.
PG  - 917324
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.917324 [doi]
AB  - Bovine leukemia virus (BLV), the causative agent of enzootic bovine leukosis, is 
      currently one of the most important pathogens affecting the cattle industry
      worldwide. Determining where and in which host it originated, and how it
      dispersed across continents will provide valuable insights into its historical
      emergence as the cattle pathogen. Various species in the Bos genus were
      domesticated in Asia, where they also diversified. As native cattle (taurine
      cattle, zebu cattle, yak, and water buffalo) are indigenous and adapted to local 
      environments, we hypothesized that Asian native cattle could have harbored BLV
      and, therefore, that they were important for virus emergence, maintenance, and
      spread. In this study, phylogeographic and ancestral trait analyses-including
      sequences obtained from Asian native cattle-were used to reconstruct the
      evolutionary history of BLV. It was shown that, since its probable emergence in
      Asia, the virus spread to South America and Europe via international trade of
      live cattle. It was inferred that zebu cattle were the hosts for the early origin
      of BLV, while taurine cattle played the significant role in the transmission
      worldwide. In addition, the results of positive selection analysis indicate that 
      yak had a substantially minor role in the transmission of this virus. In this
      study, endogenous deltaretrovirus sequences in bats, collected in Asian
      countries, were also analyzed on whether these sequences were present in the bat 
      genome. Endogenous deltaretrovirus sequences were detected from bat species
      endemic to specific regions and geographically isolated for a long time.
      Endogenous deltaretrovirus sequences from these geographically isolated species
      represent ancient exogenous deltaretroviruses distributions. The phylogenetic
      analysis revealed that these newly obtained endogenous deltaretrovirus sequences 
      were closely related to those of BLV from Asian native cattle, indicating that
      BLV-related ancient deltaretroviruses circulated in Asia long before the
      emergence of BLV. Together, our analyses provide evidence for origin and
      spatiotemporal dynamics of BLV.

PG  - 104722
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104722 [doi]
AB  - Membrane recognition by viral spike proteins is critical for infection. Here we
      show the host cell membrane-binding surfaces of severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon,
      Kappa, and Omicron as well as SARS-CoV-1 and pangolin and bat relatives. They
      show increases in membrane binding propensities over time, with all spike head
      mutations in variants, and particularly BA.1, impacting the protein's affinity to
      cell membranes. Comparison of hundreds of structures yields a progressive model
      of membrane docking in which spike protein trimers shift from initial

AB  - Biodiversity can be boosted by colonization of new habitats such as remote
      islands and separated continents. Molecular studies have suggested that recently 
      evolved organisms probably colonized already separated continents by dispersal,
      either via land bridge connections or crossing the ocean. Here we test the
      on-land and trans-marine dispersal hypotheses by evaluating possibilities of
      colonization routes over the Bering land bridge and across the Atlantic Ocean in 
      the cosmopolitan bat genus Eptesicus (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae). Previous
      molecular studies have found New World Eptesicus more closely related to
      Histiotus, a Neotropical endemic lineage with enlarged ears, than to Old World
      Eptesicus. However, phylogenetic relationships within the New World group
      remained unresolved and their evolutionary history was unclear. Here we studied
      the systematics of New World Eptesicus and Histiotus using extensive taxonomic
      and geographic sampling, and genomic data from thousands of ultra-conserved
      elements (UCEs). We estimated phylogenetic trees using concatenation and
      multispecies coalescent. All analyses supported four major New World clades and a
      novel topology where E. fuscus and Histiotus are sister clades that together
      diverged from two sister clades of Neotropical Eptesicus. Intra-clade divergence 
      suggested cryptic diversity that has been concealed by morphological features,
      especially in the Neotropics where taxonomic re-evaluations are warranted.
      Molecular dating estimated that Old World and New World clades diverged around 17
      million years ago followed by radiation of major New World clades in the
      mid-Miocene, when climatic changes might have facilitated global dispersal and
      radiation events. Biogeographic ancestral reconstruction supported the
      Neotropical origin of the New World clades, suggesting a trans-Atlantic
      colonization route from North Africa to the northern Neotropics. We highlight
      that trans-marine dispersal may be more prevalent than currently acknowledged and
      may be an important first step to global biodiversification.

      long-lived Bechstein's bat (Myotis bechsteinii).

AB  - Whether species can cope with environmental change depends considerably on their 
      life history. Bats have long lifespans and low reproductive rates which make them
      vulnerable to environmental changes. Global warming causes Bechstein's bats
      (Myotis bechsteinii) to produce larger females that face a higher mortality risk.
      Here, we test whether these larger females are able to offset their elevated
      mortality risk by adopting a faster life history. We analysed an individual-based
      25-year dataset from 331 RFID-tagged wild bats and combine genetic pedigrees with
      data on survival, reproduction and body size. We find that size-dependent
      fecundity and age at first reproduction drive the observed increase in mortality.
      Because larger females have an earlier onset of reproduction and shorter
      generation times, lifetime reproductive success remains remarkably stable across 
      individuals with different body sizes. Our study demonstrates a rapid shift to a 
      faster pace of life in a mammal with a slow life history.

AB  - This is the first study reporting the detection and molecular characterization of
      Eimeria in bats in Spain, specifically in 12 of 32 chiropteran species described 
      in the Iberian Peninsula. A total of 76 faecal samples were collected from
      different bat roosting sites across Spanish territory. The DNA was extracted from
      the samples and sequenced by targeting the Eimeria SSU-rRNA gene. Two Eimeria
      species were detected in 29 of the 76 faecal samples (38%), and the bat-specific 
      Eimeria rioarribaensis and rodent-specific Eimeria jerfinica were detected in 4
      (5%) and 25 (33%) of the samples, respectively. This is the first report of E.
      rioarribaensis in the bats Rhinolophus euryale, Myotis myotis and Nyctalus
      lasiopterus, extending the host and geographical ranges for this bat coccidian
      parasite. The identification of the rodent-specific parasite species E. jerfinica
      in bats indicates the occurrence of this species in Spain, although its presence 
      has not previously been reported in wild rodents in this country. Considering
      that most of the Eimeria spp. reported in bats were described only on the basis
      of morphometric data, molecular studies are required to determined which Eimeria 
      species occur in bats, to complete the identification of these species and to
      clarify the phylogeny.

TI  - Functional Fiber Reduces Mice Obesity by Regulating Intestinal Microbiota.
LID - 2676 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132676 [doi]
AB  - Obesity may cause metabolic syndrome and has become a global public health
      problem, and dietary fibers (DF) could alleviate obesity and metabolic syndrome
      by regulating intestinal microbiota. We developed a functional fiber (FF) with a 
      synthetic mixture of polysaccharides, high viscosity, water-binding capacity,
      swelling capacity, and fermentability. This study aimed to investigate the effect
      of FF on obesity and to determine its prevention of obesity by modulating the gut
      microbiota. Physiological, histological, and biochemical parameters, and gut
      microbiota composition were investigated in the following six groups: control
      group (Con), high-fat diet group (HFD), low-fat diet group (LFD, conversion of
      HFD to LFD), high-fat +8% FF group (8% FF), high-fat +12% FF group (12% FF), and 
      high-fat +12% FF + antibiotic group (12% FF + AB). The results demonstrated that 
      12% FF could promote a reduction in body weight and epididymal adipocyte area,
      augment insulin sensitivity, and stimulate heat production from brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) (p &lt; 0.05). Compared with the HFD, 12% FF could also
      significantly improve the intestinal morphological integrity, attenuate systemic 
      inflammation, promote intestinal microbiota homeostasis, and stabilize the
      production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (p &lt; 0.05). Consistent with the 
      results of 12% FF, the LFD could significantly reduce the body weight and
      epididymal adipocyte area relative to the HFD (p &lt; 0.05), but the LFD and HFD 
      showed no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the level of inflammation and
      SCFAs. Meanwhile, 12% FF supplementation showed an increase (p &lt; 0.05) in the 
      abundance of the Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, and Coprococcus genus in the
      intestine, which had a negative correlation with obesity and insulin resistance. 
      Additionally, the treatment with antibiotics (12% FF + AB) could inhibit the
      effect of FF in the HFD. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
      function prediction revealed that 12% FF could significantly inhibit the
      cyanogenic amino acid metabolic pathway and decrease the serum succinate
      concentration relative to the HFD group. The overall results indicate that 12% FF
      has the potential to reduce obesity through the beneficial regulation of the gut 
      microbiota and metabolites.

AB  - We studied cell recruitment following optic tectum (OT) injury in zebrafish
      (Danio rerio), which has a remarkable ability to regenerate many of its organs,
      including the brain. The OT is the largest dorsal layered structure in the
      zebrafish brain. In juveniles, it is an ideal structure for imaging and
      dissection. We investigated the recruited cells within the juvenile OT during
      regeneration in a Pdgfrbeta-Gal4:UAS-EGFP line in which pericytes, vascular,
      circulating, and meningeal cells are labeled, together with neurons and
      progenitors. We first performed high-resolution confocal microscopy and
      single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) on EGFP-positive cells. We then tested
      three types of injury with very different outcomes (needle (mean depth in the OT 
      of 200 microm); deep-laser (depth: 100 to 200 microm depth); surface-laser
      (depth: 0 to 100 microm)). Laser had the additional advantage of better mimicking
      of ischemic cerebral accidents. No massive recruitment of EGFP-positive cells was
      observed following laser injury deep in the OT. This type of injury does not
      perturb the meninx/brain-blood barrier (BBB). We also performed laser injuries at
      the surface of the OT, which in contrast create a breach in the meninges.
      Surprisingly, one day after such injury, we observed the migration to the injury 
      site of various EGFP-positive cell types at the surface of the OT. The migrating 
      cells included midline roof cells, which activated the PI3K-AKT pathway;
      fibroblast-like cells expressing numerous collagen genes and most prominently in 
      3D imaging; and a large number of arachnoid cells that probably migrate to the
      injury site through the activation of cilia motility genes, most likely being
      direct targets of the FOXJ1a gene. This study, combining high-content imaging and
      scRNAseq in physiological and pathological conditions, sheds light on meninges
      repair mechanisms in zebrafish that probably also operate in mammalian meninges.

TI  - First Complete Cytochrome B Sequences and Molecular Taxonomy of Bat Species from 
      Sri Lanka.
LID - 1674 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12131674 [doi]
AB  - This is the first report on the molecular identification and phylogeny of the
      Rousettus leschenaultii Desmarest, 1810, Rhinolophus rouxii Temminck, 1835,
      Hipposideros speoris Schneider, 1800, Hipposideros lankadiva Kelaart, 1850, and
      Miniopterus fuliginosus Kuhl, 1817, bat species in Sri Lanka, inferred from
      analyses by mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b gene sequences. Recent research 
      has indicated that bats show enormous cryptic genetic diversity. Moreover, even
      within the same species, the acoustic properties of echolocation calls and
      morphological features such as fur color could vary in different populations.
      Therefore, we have used molecular taxonomy for the accurate identification of
      five bat species recorded in one of the largest cave populations in Sri Lanka.
      The bats were caught using a hand net, and saliva samples were collected
      non-invasively from each bat by using a sterile oral swab. Nucleic acids were
      extracted from the oral swab samples, and mitochondrial DNA was amplified by
      using primers targeting the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b gene. This study
      reports the first molecular evidence for the identification of five bat species
      in Sri Lanka. Our findings will contribute to future conservation and systematic 
      studies of bats in Sri Lanka. This study will also provide the basis for a
      genetic database of Sri Lankan bats which will contribute significantly to the
      investigation of potentially zoonotic bat viruses.

TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of the human genome and six bat genomes using
      unsupervised machine learning: Mb-level CpG and TFBS islands.
PG  - 497
LID - 10.1186/s12864-022-08664-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging infectious disease-causing RNA viruses, such as the
      SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola viruses, are thought to rely on bats as natural reservoir
      hosts. Since these zoonotic viruses pose a great threat to humans, it is
      important to characterize the bat genome from multiple perspectives. Unsupervised
      machine learning methods for extracting novel information from big sequence data 
      without prior knowledge or particular models are highly desirable for obtaining
      unexpected insights. We previously established a batch-learning self-organizing
      map (BLSOM) of the oligonucleotide composition that reveals novel genome
      characteristics from big sequence data. RESULTS: In this study, using the
      oligonucleotide BLSOM, we conducted a comparative genomic study of humans and six
      bat species. BLSOM is an explainable-type machine learning algorithm that reveals
      the diagnostic oligonucleotides contributing to sequence clustering
      (self-organization). When unsupervised machine learning reveals unexpected and/or
      characteristic features, these features can be studied in more detail via the
      much simpler and more direct standard distribution map method. Based on this
      combined strategy, we identified the Mb-level enrichment of CG dinucleotide
      (Mb-level CpG islands) around the termini of bat long-scaffold sequences. In
      addition, a class of CG-containing oligonucleotides were enriched in the
      centromeric and pericentromeric regions of human chromosomes. Oligonucleotides
      longer than tetranucleotides often represent binding motifs for a wide variety of
      proteins (e.g., transcription factor binding sequences (TFBSs)). By analyzing the
      penta- and hexanucleotide composition, we observed the evident enrichment of a
      wide range of hexanucleotide TFBSs in centromeric and pericentromeric
      heterochromatin regions on all human chromosomes. CONCLUSION: Function of
      transcription factors (TFs) beyond their known regulation of gene expression
      (e.g., TF-mediated looping interactions between two different genomic regions)
      has received wide attention. The Mb-level TFBS and CpG islands are thought to be 
      involved in the large-scale nuclear organization, such as centromere and telomere
      clustering. TFBSs, which are enriched in centromeric and pericentromeric
      heterochromatin regions, are thought to play an important role in the formation
      of nuclear 3D structures. Our machine learning-based analysis will help us to
      understand the differential features of nuclear 3D structures in the human and
      bat genomes.

      secretion of S100b.
PG  - 407
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04441-9 [doi]
AB  - Brown and beige adipose tissues dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat to 
      maintain your body temperature in cold conditions. The impaired function of these
      tissues results in various metabolic diseases in humans and mice. By
      bioinformatical analyses, we identified a functional thermogenic regulator of
      adipose tissue, Androgen-dependent tissue factor pathway inhibitor
      [TFPI]-regulating protein (Adtrp), which was significantly overexpressed in and
      functionally activated the mature brown/beige adipocytes. Hereby, we knocked out 
      Adtrp in mice which led to multiple abnormalities in thermogenesis, metabolism,
      and maturation of brown/beige adipocytes causing excess lipid accumulation in
      brown adipose tissue (BAT) and cold intolerance. The capability of thermogenesis 
      in brown/beige adipose tissues could be recovered in Adtrp KO mice upon direct
      beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) stimulation by CL316,243 treatment. Our
      mechanistic studies revealed that Adtrp by binding to S100 calcium-binding
      protein b (S100b) indirectly mediated the secretion of S100b, which in turn
      promoted the beta3-AR mediated thermogenesis via sympathetic innervation. These
      results may provide a novel insight into Adtrp in metabolism via regulating the
      differentiation and thermogenesis of adipose tissues in mice.

TI  - Interplay of matrix stiffness and stress relaxation in directing osteogenic
      differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.
LID - 10.1039/d2bm00485b [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the stiffness and stress
      relaxation of poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels on the osteogenic
      differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Varying the amount of
      the crosslinker and the ratio between the monomers enabled the obtainment of
      hydrogels with controlled mechanical properties, as characterized using
      unconfined compression and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Subsequently, the
      surface of the hydrogels was functionalized with a mimetic peptide of the BMP-2
      protein, in order to favor the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Finally,
      hMSCs were cultured on the hydrogels with different stiffness and stress
      relaxation: 15 kPa - 15%, 60 kPa - 15%, 140 kPa - 15%, 100 kPa - 30%, and 140 kPa
      - 70%. The cells on hydrogels with stiffnesses from 60 kPa to 140 kPa presented a
      star-like shape, typical of osteocytes, which has only been reported by our group
      for two-dimensional substrates. Then, the extent of hMSC differentiation was
      evaluated by using immunofluorescence and by quantifying the expression of both
      osteoblast markers (Runx-2 and osteopontin) and osteocyte markers (E11, DMP1, and
      sclerostin). It was found that a stiffness of 60 kPa led to a higher expression
      of osteocyte markers as compared to stiffnesses of 15 and 140 kPa. Finally, the
      strongest expression of osteoblast and osteocyte differentiation markers was
      observed for the hydrogel with a high relaxation of 70% and a stiffness of 140
      kPa.

TI  - Induction of beige-like adipocyte markers and functions in 3T3-L1 cells by Clk1
      and PKCbetaII inhibitory molecules.

LID - 10.1111/jcmm.17345 [doi]
AB  - Excessive dietary intake of fat results in its storage in white adipose tissue
      (WAT). Energy expenditure through lipid oxidation occurs in brown adipose tissue 
      (BAT). Certain WAT depots can undergo a change termed beiging where markers that 
      BAT express are induced. Little is known about signalling pathways inducing
      beiging. Here, inhibition of a signalling pathway regulating alternative pre-mRNA
      splicing is involved in adipocyte beiging. Clk1/2/4 kinases regulate splicing by 
      phosphorylating factors that process pre-mRNA. Clk1 inhibition by TG003 results
      in beige-like adipocytes highly expressing PGC1alpha and UCP1. SiRNA for Clk1, 2 
      and 4, demonstrated that Clk1 depletion increased UCP1 and PGC1alpha expression, 
      whereas Clk2/4 siRNA did not. TG003-treated adipocytes contained fewer lipid
      droplets, are smaller, and contain more mitochondria, resulting in proton leak
      increases. Additionally, inhibition of PKCbetaII activity, a splice variant
      regulated by Clk1, increased beiging. PGC1alpha is a substrate for both Clk1 and 
      PKCbetaII kinases, and we surmised that inhibition of PGC1alpha phosphorylation
      resulted in beiging of adipocytes. We show that TG003 binds Clk1 more than Clk2/4
      through direct binding, and PGC1alpha binds to Clk1 at a site close to TG003.
      Furthermore, we show that TG003 is highly specific for Clk1 across hundreds of
      kinases in our activity screen. Hence, Clk1 inhibition becomes a target for
      induction of beige adipocytes.

TI  - HE-DFNETS: A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for the Prediction of
      Potential Fishing Zone Areas in Indian Ocean Using Remote Sensing Images.
PG  - 5081541
LID - 10.1155/2022/5081541 [doi]
AB  - The Indian subcontinent is known for its larger coastline spanning, over 8100 km 
      and is considered the habitat for many millions of people. The livelihood of
      their habitat is purely dependent upon the fishing activities. Often, the search 
      for fish requires more time for catching and more resources, thus increasing the 
      operational cost leading to low profitability. With the advent of artificial
      intelligence algorithms, designing intelligent algorithms for an effective
      prediction of fishing areas has reached new heights in terms of high accuracy (A 
      cy ) and less time. But still, predicting the location of potential fishing zones
      (PFZs) is always a daunting task. To reduce these issues, this work presented the
      novel hybrid prediction architecture of PFZs using remote sensing images. The
      proposed architecture integrates the deep convolutional layers and flitter bat
      optimized long short-term memory (FB-LSTM)-based recurrent neural networks (RNN).
      These convolutional layers are utilized to remove the various color features such
      as chlorophyll, sea surface temperature (SST), and GPS location from the
      satellite images, and FB-LTSM is utilized to predict the potential locations for 
      fishing. The extensive experimentations are carried out utilizing the satellite
      data from Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and
      implemented using TensorFlow 1.18 with Keras API. The performance metrics such as
      prediction A cy , precision (P scn ), recall (R cl ) or sensitivity (S ty ),
      specificity (S fy ), and F1-score and compared with other existing intelligent
      learning models. From our observations, the proposed architecture (99% prediction
      A cy ) has outperformed the other existing algorithms and finds its best place in
      designing an intelligent system for better predicting of PFZs.

TI  - Validation of the Hungarian Version of the SarQoL(R) Questionnaire and Its
      Association with the SARC-F Screening Tool.
PG  - 267-273
LID - 10.14283/jfa.2021.53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Following the publication of a culturally adapted version of the
      original SarQoL(R) questionnaire in Hungarian language, we aimed to test its
      psychometric properties and its association with the SARC-F screening instrument.
      DESIGN: This cross-sectional validation study recruited elderly people from 2
      nursing homes and an endocrinology clinic. All participants were screened for
      sarcopenia with the SARC-F tool, had their muscle mass measured with
      bioelectrical impedance analysis, as well as grip strength and gait speed.
      Sarcopenia was diagnosed with the EWGSOP2 criteria. Participants completed the
      SarQoL questionnaire, the SF-36, the EQ-5D and the EQ-VAS. Validation consisted
      of analyzing discriminative power, internal consistency, construct validity and
      floor- and ceiling effects. A multivariate regression model was used to evaluate 
      the association between QoL, the SARC-F questionnaire, and a number of
      demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: A total of 70 participants, aged
      80.00 (68.50 - 82.50) years, were included. Discriminative power between
      sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic subjects was found for all domains, except domain 7 
      (Fears) when dividing study population based on the SARC-F score. We also found
      significantly lower QoL for domains 4 (Functionality) and 5 (Activities of daily 
      living) when splitting participants based on muscle strength (Probable sarcopenia
      - EWGSOP2 definition). All domains showed a strong or moderate correlation with
      the total SarQoL score. Conceptually similar domains of other generic QoL
      questionnaires significantly correlated with the total SarQol score, confirming
      its convergent validity. Low correlations were found with different domains
      (divergent validity). No floor or ceiling effects were observed. Using a
      regression model, the components "strength" and "stair climbing" of the SARC-F
      questionnaire were significantly associated with the QoL of our patients assessed
      with the SarQoL instrument. CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia risk assessed with the Sarc-F 
      instrument was significantly associated with QoL measured with the SarQol
      questionnaire. High internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity and
      no floor and ceiling effects characterised the Hungarian language SarQoL(R)
      questionnaire. Due to some limitations, further multi-center designed studies are
      needed to verify the validity of the SarQol questionnaire.

TI  - Curation of a reference database of COI sequences for insect identification
      through DNA metabarcoding: COins.

AB  - DNA metabarcoding is a widespread approach for the molecular identification of
      organisms. While the associated wet-lab and data processing procedures are well
      established and highly efficient, the reference databases for taxonomic
      assignment can be implemented to improve the accuracy of identifications. Insects
      are among the organisms for which DNA-based identification is most commonly used;
      yet, a DNA-metabarcoding reference database specifically curated for their
      species identification using software requiring local databases is lacking. Here,
      we present COins, a database of 5' region cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
      sequences (COI-5P) of insects that includes over 532 000 representative sequences
      of >106 000 species specifically formatted for the QIIME2 software platform.
      Through a combination of automated and manually curated steps, we developed this 
      database starting from all COI sequences available in the Barcode of Life Data
      System for insects, focusing on sequences that comply with several standards,
      including a species-level identification. COins was validated on previously
      published DNA-metabarcoding sequences data (bulk samples from Malaise traps) and 
      its efficiency compared with other publicly available reference databases (not
      specific for insects). COins can allow an increase of up to 30% of species-level 
      identifications and thus can represent a valuable resource for the taxonomic
      assignment of insects' DNA-metabarcoding data, especially when species-level
      identification is needed https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19130465.v1.

AB  - In order to improve the scientificity of sports action analysis, this paper
      constructs a sports action analysis model based on machine learning based on the 
      greedy algorithm and the bat algorithm. According to the structural
      characteristics of the model, the structure of the model is reflected in the form
      of face order, that is, the face neighborhood structure. Moreover, this paper
      judges the degree of similarity between model faces through the pros and cons of 
      the order and applies it to the structural similarity matrix between models. In
      addition, this paper establishes corresponding mathematical models for the shape 
      and structure of the model and constructs the shape similarity matrix, the
      surface neighborhood structure similarity matrix, and the structure similarity
      matrix between the source model and the target model. Finally, this paper designs
      and implements CAD model retrieval methods based on greedy algorithm and bat
      algorithm and designs experiments to compare the performance of the algorithm
      proposed in this paper with traditional algorithms. The result of the experiment 
      shows that the algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious advantages in sports 
      action analysis compared with the traditional algorithm.

AB  - Light quality plays an essential role in setting plant structural and functional 
      traits, including antioxidant compounds. This paper aimed to assess how
      manipulating the light spectrum during growth may regulate the photosynthetic
      activity and fruit bioactive compound synthesis in Solanum lycopersicum L. cv.
      'Microtom' to improve plant physiological performance and fruit nutritional
      value. Plants were cultivated under three light quality regimes: red-green-blue
      LEDs (RGB), red-blue LEDs (RB) and white fluorescent lamps (FL), from sowing to
      fruit ripening. Leaf functional traits, photosynthetic efficiency, Rubisco and D1
      protein expression, and antioxidant production in fruits were analyzed. Compared 
      to FL, RGB and RB regimes reduced height and increased leaf number and specific
      leaf area, enhancing plant dwarf growth. The RGB regime improved photosynthesis
      and stomatal conductance despite lower biomass, favoring Rubisco synthesis and
      carboxylation rate than RB and FL regimes. The RB light produced plants with
      fewer flowers and fruits with a lower ascorbic acid amount but the highest
      polyphenol content, antioxidant capacity and SOD and CAT activities. Our data
      indicate that the high percentage of the green wavelength in the RGB regime
      promoted photosynthesis and reduced plant reproductive capacity compared to FL
      and RB. Conversely, the RB regime was the best in favoring the production of
      health-promoting compounds in tomato berries.

TI  - Why link diverse citizen science surveys? Widespread arboreal habits of a
      terrestrial amphibian revealed by mammalian tree surveys in Britain.
PG  - e0265156
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0265156 [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial anurans, with their typically short limbs, heavy-set bodies and
      absent claws or toe pads are incongruous tree climbers, but even occasional
      arboreal locomotion could offer substantial advantages for evading predators or
      accessing new shelter or food resources. Despite recent interest, arboreal
      behaviour remains rarely and unsystematically described for terrestrial
      amphibians in Europe, likely due to fundamental differences in survey methods and
      therefore a lack of field data. However, other taxa surveys specifically target
      trees and tree cavities. We undertook collaborations and large-scale data
      searches with two major citizen science projects surveying for arboreal mammals
      in Britain to investigate potential tree climbing by amphibians at a national
      scale. Remarkably, we found widespread arboreal usage by amphibians in England
      and Wales, with occupancy of hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellenarius) nest
      boxes, tree cavities investigated as potential bat roosts and even a bird nest,
      by common toads (Bufo bufo), but few additional records of frogs or newts. Of the
      277-400 sites surveyed annually for dormice since 2009 at least 18 sites had
      amphibians recorded in nest boxes while of the 1388 trees surveyed for bats a
      total 1.4% (19 trees) had toads present. Common toads were found using cavities
      in seven tree species and especially goat willow (Salix caprea). Toads are
      potentially attracted to tree cavities and arboreal nests because they provide
      safe and damp microenvironments which can support an abundance of invertebrate
      prey but the importance of such tree microhabitats for toad conservation remains 
      unknown and our results should be interpreted cautiously. We encourage expanding 
      and linking of unrelated biodiversity monitoring surveys and citizen science
      initiatives as valuable tools for investigating ecological traits and
      interactions.

      mechanisms leading to the specific recognition of Guanine Guadruplex (G4) by
      DARPins peptides, which can lead to the design of G4s specific sensors. To this
      end we carried out all-atom molecular dynamic simulations to unravel the
      interactions between specific nucleic acids, including human-telomeric (h-telo), 
      Bcl-2, and <italic>c-Myc</italic>, with different peptides, forming a DARPin/G4
      complex. By comparing the sequences of DARPin with that of a peptide known for
      its high affinity for <italic>c-Myc</italic>, we show that the recognition cannot
      be ascribed to sequence similarity but, instead, depends on the complementarity
      between the three-dimensional arrangement of the molecular fragments involved:
      the &alpha;-helix/loops domain of DARPin and the G4 backbone. Our results reveal 
      that DARPins tertiary structure presents a charged hollow region in which G4 can 
      be hosted, thus the more complementary the structural shapes, the more stable the
      interaction.</span><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p></span></p>.

TI  - Efficacy of avapritinib versus best available therapy in the treatment of
      advanced systemic mastocytosis.
PG  - 2108-2120
LID - 10.1038/s41375-022-01615-z [doi]
AB  - Advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) is a rare myeloid neoplasm associated with
      poor overall survival (OS). This study (NCT04695431) compared clinical outcomes
      between patients with AdvSM treated with avapritinib in the Phase 1 EXPLORER
      (NCT0256198) and Phase 2 PATHFINDER (NCT03580655) trials (N = 176) and patients
      treated with best available therapy (BAT; N = 141). A multi-center,
      observational, retrospective chart review study was conducted at six study sites 
      (four European, two American) to collect data from patients with AdvSM who
      received BAT; these data were pooled with data from EXPLORER and PATHFINDER.
      Comparisons between outcomes of OS, duration of treatment (DOT), and maximum
      reduction in serum tryptase were conducted between the treatment cohorts, with
      adjustment for key covariates. The results indicated that the avapritinib cohort 
      had significantly better survival (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence
      interval (CI)): 0.48 (0.29, 0.79); p = 0.004) and significantly longer DOT (HR:
      0.36 (0.26, 0.51); p < 0.001) compared to the BAT cohort. Additionally, the mean 
      difference in percentage maximum reduction in serum tryptase levels was 60.3%
      greater in the avapritinib cohort (95% CI: -72.8, -47.9; p < 0.001). With no
      randomized controlled trials comparing avapritinib to BAT, these data offer
      crucial insights into the improved efficacy of avapritinib for the treatment of
      AdvSM.

TI  - Apoptotic brown adipocytes enhance energy expenditure via extracellular inosine.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05041-0 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy(1,2) and promotes cardio-metabolic
      health(3). Loss of BAT during obesity and aging is a principal hurdle for
      BAT-centered obesity therapies, but not much is known about BAT apoptosis. Here, 
      untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that apoptotic brown adipocytes release a
      specific pattern of metabolites with purine metabolites being highly enriched.
      Interestingly, this apoptotic secretome enhances expression of the thermogenic
      program in healthy adipocytes. This effect is mediated by the purine inosine
      which stimulates energy expenditure (EE) in brown adipocytes via the cAMP/protein
      kinase A signaling pathway. Treatment of mice with inosine increased
      BAT-dependent EE and induced "browning" of white adipose tissue. Mechanistically,
      the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1, SLC29A1) regulates inosine
      levels in BAT: ENT1-deficiency increases extracellular inosine levels and
      consequently enhances thermogenic adipocyte differentiation. In mice,
      pharmacological inhibition of ENT1 as well as global and adipose-specific
      ablation enhanced BAT activity and counteracted diet-induced obesity,
      respectively. In human brown adipocytes, knockdown or blockade of ENT1 increased 
      extracellular inosine, which enhanced thermogenic capacity. Conversely, high ENT1
      levels correlated with lower expression of the thermogenic marker UCP1 in human
      adipose tissues. Finally, the Ile216Thr loss of function mutation in human ENT1
      was associated with significantly lower BMI and 59% lower odds of obesity for
      individuals carrying the Thr variant. Our data identify inosine as a metabolite
      released during apoptosis with "replace me" signaling function that regulates
      thermogenic fat and counteracts obesity.

PG  - e202200134
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202200134 [doi]
AB  - The lichen's special symbiotic structure enables it to produce bioactive
      substances. They have historically been recognized for their aesthetic and
      medicinal benefits. Furthermore, in recent years, they have performed in various 
      fields, including perfumery, dyeing, and pharmacology due to their rich secondary
      metabolites. From our study, four compounds were isolated from organic extracts
      of Parmotrema hypoleucinum, Roccella phycopsis, and Xanthoria parietina and
      identified by spectroscopic investigation as atranorin, (+)-iso-usnic acid,
      methyl orsellinate, and parietin, respectively. The anti-inflammatory effects of 
      lichens extracts, and pure compounds were evaluated on RAW 264.7 macrophages
      cells at different concentrations. At 25 mug/mL all treated samples did not show 
      any effect on cell viability. Atranorin and (+)-iso-usnic acid showed an
      inhibitory effect on nitric oxide (NO) levels in lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Nitric oxide (NO) production was measured using
      Griess reagent, atranorin and (+)-iso-usnic acid showed a high anti-inflammatory 
      potential (75.99 % and 57.27 % at 25 mug/mL). On the other hand, methyl
      orsellinate and the organic extracts of three lichens showed good
      anti-inflammatory activity ranging from 29.16 % at 25 mug/mL to 86.91 % at 100
      mug/mL.

AB  - Food resource availability is one of the most important factors affecting
      interindividual competition in a variety of animal species. However, the energy
      budget and territory aggression strategy of small mammals during periods of food 
      restriction remain uncertain. In this study, metabolic rate, body temperature,
      territory aggression behavior, and fat deposit were measured in male striped
      hamster (Cricetulus barabensis) restricted by 20% of ad libitum food intake with 
      or without supplementary methimazole. Serum thyroid hormone (tri-iodothyronine,
      T3 and thyroxine, T4), and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in liver, brown
      adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, were also measured. Attack latency, total
      attack times and duration, and the interval duration between attacks of resident 
      hamsters were not significantly changed during food restriction, which was not
      significantly affected by supplementary methimazole. Metabolic rate and body
      temperature was significantly increased in food-restricted hamsters following
      introduction of an intruder, which was not completely blocked by supplementary
      methimazole. Serum T3 and T4 levels and BAT COX activity were not significantly
      changed following aggression, and were significantly decreased by supplementary
      methimazole. These findings suggest that striped hamsters increase energy
      expenditure for territory aggression during food restriction, and consequently
      lead to excessive energy depletion. Territory aggression behavior may decrease
      the capacity to cope with food shortage, which may be independent of thyroid
      hormone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothermia is a complex pathophysiological response that can be
      life-threatening in low-temperature environment because of impaired
      thermoregulation. However, there is currently no clinically effective drugs that 
      can prevent or treat this disease. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation or
      browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a promising therapeutic strategy to
      prevent or treat hypothermia. Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz extract (AE) and
      its active compound Atractylenolide III (AIII) has been reported to regulate
      glycolipid metabolism, which might be relevant to BAT activation. However, the
      thermogenic effect and mechanism of AE and AIII on adipose tissues have not been 
      explored yet. Therefore, this study firstly investigated the role of AE and AIII 
      on hypothermia by promoting heat production of BAT and WAT. PURPOSE: To explore
      the anti-cold effect of AE and AIII in cold exposure model and explore their
      biological function and mechanism underlying thermogenesis. METHODS: The effect
      of thermogenesis and anti-hypothermia of AE and AIII on C57BL/6J mice were
      evaluated with several experiment in cold environment, such as toxicity test,
      cold exposure test, metabolism estimation, histology and immunohistochemistry,
      and protein expression. Additionally, BAT, inguinal WAT (iWAT) and brown
      adipocytes were utilized to explore the mechanism of AE and AIII on thermogenesis
      in vivo and in vitro. Finally, SIRT1 agonist and inhibitor in brown adipocytes to
      verify that AIII activated BAT through SIRT1/PGC-1alpha pathway. RESULTS: Both AE
      and A could significantly maintain the core body temperature and body surface
      temperature of mice during cold exposure. Besides, AE and A could significantly
      improve the capacity of total antioxidant and glucose, lipid metabolism of mice. 
      In addition, AE and AIII reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content
      both in BAT and brown adipocytes, and decreased the size of lipid droplets.
      Moreover, AE and A promoted the expression of proteins related to heat production
      in BAT and iWAT. And AIII might activate BAT via SIRT1/PGC-1alpha pathway.
      CONCLUSION: AE and A were potential candidate drugs that treated hypothermia by
      improving the heat production capacity of the mice. Mechanistically, they may
      activate SIRT1/PGC-1alpha pathway, thus enhancing the function of BAT, and
      promoting the browning of iWAT, to act as anti-hypothermia candidate medicine.

      echolocating bat (Rhinolophus affinis).
PG  - e9025

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene
      expression and play key roles in many biological processes, such as development
      and response to multiple stresses. However, little is known about their roles in 
      generating novel phenotypes and phenotypic variation during the course of animal 
      evolution. Here, we, for the first time, characterized the miRNAs of the cochlea 
      in an echolocating bat (Rhinolophus affinis). We sampled eight individuals from
      two R. affinis subspecies with significant echolocation call frequency
      differences. We identified 365 miRNAs and 121 of them were novel. By searching
      sequences of these miRNAs precursors in multiple high-quality mammal genomes, we 
      found one specific miRNA shared by all echolocating bats but not present in all
      other nonecholocating mammals. The targeted genes of this miRNA included several 
      known hearing genes (e.g., KCNQ4 and GJB6). Together with the matched mRNA-seq
      data, we identified 1766 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two
      subspecies and 555 of them were negatively regulated by differentially expressed 
      miRNAs (DEMs). We found that almost half of known hearing genes in the list of
      all DEGs were regulated negatively by DEMs, suggesting an important role of
      miRNAs in call frequency variation of the two subspecies. These targeted DEGs
      included several important hearing genes (e.g., Piezo1, Piezo2, and CDH23) that
      have been shown to be important in ultrasonic hearing of echolocating mammals.

      generalist predators.
PG  - e8978
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8978 [doi]
AB  - The extent to which persisting species may fill the functional role of extirpated
      or declining species has profound implications for the structure of biological
      communities and ecosystem functioning. In North America, arthropodivorous bats
      are threatened on a continent-wide scale by the spread of white-nose syndrome
      (WNS), a disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. We tested
      whether bat species that display lower mortality from this disease can partially 
      fill the functional role of other bat species experiencing population declines.
      Specifically, we performed high-throughput amplicon sequencing of guano from two 
      generalist predators: the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bat
      (Eptesicus fuscus). We then compared changes in prey consumption before versus
      after population declines related to WNS. Dietary niches contracted for both
      species after large and abrupt declines in little brown bats and smaller declines
      in big brown bats, but interspecific dietary overlap did not change. Furthermore,
      the incidence and taxonomic richness of agricultural pest taxa detected in diet
      samples decreased following bat population declines. Our results suggest that
      persisting generalist predators do not necessarily expand their dietary niches
      following population declines in other predators, providing further evidence that
      the functional roles of different generalist predators are ecologically distinct.

TI  - Airport noise disturbs foraging behavior of Japanese pipistrelle bats.
PG  - e8976
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8976 [doi]
AB  - The expansion of anthropogenic noise poses an emerging threat to the survival and
      reproductive success of various organisms. Previous investigations have focused
      on the detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise on the foraging behavior in
      some terrestrial and aquatic animals. Nevertheless, the role of airport noise in 
      impairing foraging activities of most wild animals has been neglected. Here, we
      aimed to assess whether foraging behavior in free-living Japanese pipistrelle
      bats (Pipistrellus abramus) can be disturbed by airport noise. We used audio
      recording to monitor foraging activities of bats at 11 sites around the runway of
      a municipal airport. We quantified noise level and spectra, aircraft activity,
      habitat type, nightly temperature, wind speed, and moon phase for each site. The 
      analysis revealed that noise level and aircraft activity were significant
      negative predictors for the number of bat passes and feeding buzzes around the
      runway, even after controlling for the effects of other environmental factors.
      There was no marked spectral overlap between bat echolocation pulses and airport 
      noise in the presence and absence of low-flying aircraft. The spectro-temporal
      parameters of echolocation vocalizations emitted by bats were dependent on noise 
      level, aircraft activity, and habitat type. These results provide correlative
      evidence that airport noise can reduce foraging activities of wild pipistrelle
      bats. Our findings add to the current knowledge of adverse impacts of airport
      noise on foraging bats in artificial ecosystems and provide a basis for further
      research on the mechanisms behind noise pollution near airports.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) functions as a thermogenic organ and is negatively
      associated with cardiometabolic diseases. N(6) -methyladenosine (m(6) A)
      modulation regulates the fate of stem cells. Here, we show that the prostaglandin
      E2 (PGE2 )-E-prostanoid receptor 3 (EP3) axis was activated during mouse
      interscapular BAT development. Disruption of EP3 impaired the browning process
      during adipocyte differentiation from pre-adipocytes. Brown adipocyte-specific
      depletion of EP3 compromised interscapular BAT formation and aggravated high-fat 
      diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in vivo. Mechanistically, activation 
      of EP3 stabilized the Zfp410 mRNA via WTAP-mediated m(6) A modification, while
      knockdown of Zfp410 abolished the EP3-induced enhancement of brown adipogenesis. 
      EP3 prevented ubiquitin-mediated degradation of WTAP by eliminating PKA-mediated 
      ERK1/2 inhibition during brown adipocyte differentiation. Ablation of WTAP in
      brown adipocytes abrogated the protective effect of EP3 overexpression in
      high-fat diet-fed mice. Inhibition of EP3 also retarded human embryonic stem cell
      differentiation into mature brown adipocytes by reducing the WTAP levels. Thus, a
      conserved PGE2 -EP3 axis promotes BAT development by stabilizing WTAP/Zfp410
      signaling in a PKA/ERK1/2-dependent manner.

TI  - Classification of new morbillivirus and jeilongvirus sequences from bats sampled 
      in Brazil and Malaysia.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05500-z [doi]
AB  - As part of a broad One Health surveillance effort to detect novel viruses in
      wildlife and people, we report several paramyxovirus sequences sampled primarily 
      from bats during 2013 and 2014 in Brazil and Malaysia, including seven from which
      we recovered full-length genomes. Of these, six represent the first full-length
      paramyxovirid genomes sequenced from the Americas, including two that are the
      first full-length bat morbillivirus genome sequences published to date. Our
      findings add to the vast number of viral sequences in public repositories, which 
      have been increasing considerably in recent years due to the rising accessibility
      of metagenomics. Taxonomic classification of these sequences in the absence of
      phenotypic data has been a significant challenge, particularly in the subfamily
      Orthoparamyxovirinae, where the rate of discovery of novel sequences has been
      substantial. Using pairwise amino acid sequence classification (PAASC), we
      propose that five of these sequences belong to members of the genus Jeilongvirus 
      and two belong to members of the genus Morbillivirus. We also highlight
      inconsistencies in the classification of Tupaia virus and Mojiang virus using the
      same demarcation criteria and suggest reclassification of these viruses into new 
      genera. Importantly, this study underscores the critical importance of sequence
      length in PAASC analysis as well as the importance of biological characteristics 
      such as genome organization in the taxonomic classification of viral sequences.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), an important member of the CYP metabolic enzyme
      family in the liver, regulates the disposal of drugs and the biotransformation of
      endogenous substances. Although previous studies have found that CYP2E1 is
      related to energy metabolism, the role of CYP2E1 in energy homeostasis remains
      unclear. Herein this study shows that the deletion of Cyp2e1 gene in rats can
      prevent obesity, fatty liver and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet.
      Mechanism studies uncover that Cyp2e1 deficiency not only increases the
      expression of thermogenic genes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and subcutaneous
      adipose tissue (SAT), but also promotes fatty acid metabolism in the liver and
      BAT. In particular, Cyp2e1 deficiency elevates energy expenditure through an
      increase of liver-generated acylcarnitines, which promote BAT thermogenesis and
      increase beta-oxidation. Interestingly, disulfiram as a CYP2E1 inhibitor can also
      prevent obesity induced by high-fat diet in normal rats. In general, this study
      explains the relationship between CYP2E1 and energy metabolism, and provides a
      new perspective for the prevention and treatment of obesity.

AB  - (226)Ra is an ultra-trace element with important environmental implications for
      many industries (including water treatment and oil and mineral extraction). Its
      extremely low concentrations in natural environments do not allow for direct
      observation and measurement of the (226)Ra-bearing minerals governing (226)Ra
      mobility. To better understand the retention processes for (226)Ra in rocks and
      soil, a synthesized assemblage of (226)Ra-doped minerals was made, combining
      montmorillonite, ferrihydrite and barite. A new methodology was developed using
      alpha activity maps acquired using alpha autoradiography, and elemental maps by
      using SEM/EDS. These maps were processed using a global approach, considering the
      entirety of the signal. The comparison of the alpha activity map and the
      elemental map enabled a correlation to be established between the (226)Ra
      activity and the chemical composition and identification of the main
      (226)Ra-bearing mineral of the assemblage, from which we were able to estimate
      the contribution of each mineral to the total activity of the assemblage, and to 
      quantify the (226)Ra-activity for each mineral. This methodology makes it
      possible to link mineralogy and occurrence of (226)Ra at the scale of the mineral
      (tens of mum). It can be applied to natural samples, including fine-grained
      samples with a complex mineralogy.

TI  - Longitudinal bleeding assessment in von Willebrand disease utilizing an interim
      bleeding score.
LID - 10.1111/jth.15807 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of bleeding phenotype is critically important in the
      diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD). Despite advances in bleeding
      assessment tools (BATs), standardized tools to evaluate bleeding following
      diagnosis (interim bleeding) are lacking. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the clinical
      utility of an interim bleeding protocol in a multicenter, international study
      involving patients with VWD. METHODS: The enrolment ISTH BAT formed the original 
      bleeding score (0 BS). At follow-up, the International Society on Thrombosis and 
      Haemostasis BAT was repeated but included only interval bleeding (Interim BS, 1
      BS). Both scores were annualized (0 BS/yr, 1 BS/yr). BS were analyzed by VWD
      subtype, plasma VWF level, sex, and age. RESULTS: Interim BS discriminated by
      subtype, with significantly increased 0 BS and 1 BS in patients with type 3 VWD. 
      In patients with type 1 VWD, a positive or negative 0 BS did not predict future
      bleeding, with similar 1 BS/yr (median 1.0 vs. 0.7, p = .2). Despite
      significantly higher 0 BS in females with type 1 VWD than males (median 7 vs. 5, 
      p = .0012), 1 BS were not significantly different (median 4 vs. 4, p = .16).
      While 0 BS were lower in children than adults with type 1 VWD, interim BS were
      similar (median 5 vs. 3, p = .5; 1BS/yr, median 1 vs. 0.8, p = .7).
      Interestingly, in those with plasma von Willebrand factor:ristocetin cofactor
      levels >50 IU/dl, interim BS rates were similar to those 30-50 IU/dl (1 BS/yr 0.8
      vs. 1.3, p = .5). CONCLUSION: This study provides both a new approach to
      longitudinal bleeding assessment and insights into the evolution of bleeding in
      VWD.

TI  - Clustering and mapping the first COVID-19 outbreak in France.
PG  - 1279
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13537-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With more than 160 000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and about 30 000
      deceased people at the end of June 2020, France was one of the countries most
      affected by the coronavirus crisis worldwide. We aim to assess the efficiency of 
      global lockdown policy in limiting spatial contamination through an in-depth
      reanalysis of spatial statistics in France during the first lockdown and
      immediate post-lockdown phases. METHODS: To reach that goal, we use an integrated
      approach at the crossroads of geography, spatial epidemiology, and public health 
      science. To eliminate any ambiguity relevant to the scope of the study, attention
      focused at first on data quality assessment. The data used originate from
      official databases (Sante Publique France) and the analysis is performed at a
      departmental level. We then developed spatial autocorrelation analysis, thematic 
      mapping, hot spot analysis, and multivariate clustering. RESULTS: We observe the 
      extreme heterogeneity of local situations and demonstrate that clustering and
      intensity are decorrelated indicators. Thematic mapping allows us to identify
      five "ghost" clusters, whereas hot spot analysis detects two positive and two
      negative clusters. Our re-evaluation also highlights that spatial dissemination
      follows a twofold logic, zonal contiguity and linear development, thus
      determining a "metastatic" propagation pattern. CONCLUSIONS: One of the most
      problematic issues about COVID-19 management by the authorities is the limited
      capacity to identify hot spots. Clustering of epidemic events is often biased
      because of inappropriate data quality assessment and algorithms eliminating
      statistical-spatial outliers. Enhanced detection techniques allow for a better
      identification of hot and cold spots, which may lead to more effective political 
      decisions during epidemic outbreaks.

      simulation.
PG  - 4039
LID - 10.1121/10.0011737 [doi]
AB  - The practicality of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was confirmed
      by comparing head-related transfer functions obtained from a three-dimensional
      (3D) digital model of a bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon) head with acoustic
      experiments using a 3D printed physical model. Furthermore, we simulated the
      auditory directionality using a 3D digital model that was modified based on the
      pinna movement of a bat during echolocation and found that the alternating
      movements of the left and right pinna result in a binaural sound pressure
      difference for vertical sources. Using the FDTD method, suitable for simulating
      acoustics in large spaces, we could analyze in detail the binaural echoes that
      bats receive and the acoustic cues they use for echolocation.

TI  - Spatial acuity of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) biosonar system
      with a bat and human comparison.
PG  - 3847
LID - 10.1121/10.0011676 [doi]
AB  - Horizontal angular resolution was measured in two bottlenose dolphins using a
      two-alternative forced-choice, biosonar target discrimination paradigm. The task 
      required a stationary dolphin positioned in a hoop to discriminate two physical
      targets at a range of 4 m. The angle separating the targets was manipulated to
      estimate an angular discrimination threshold of 1.5 degrees . In a second
      experiment, a similar two-target biosonar discrimination task was conducted with 
      one free-swimming dolphin, to test whether its emission beam was a critical
      factor in discriminating the targets. The spatial separation between two targets 
      was manipulated to measure a discrimination threshold of 6.7 cm. There was a
      relationship between differences in acoustic signals received at each target and 
      the dolphin's performance. The results of the angular resolution experiment were 
      in good agreement with measures of the minimum audible angle of both dolphins and
      humans and remarkably similar to measures of angular difference discrimination in
      echolocating dolphins, bats, and humans. The results suggest that horizontal
      auditory spatial acuity may be a common feature of the mammalian auditory system 
      rather than a specialized feature exclusive to echolocating auditory predators.

TI  - Tunneling motion and splitting in the CH2OH radical: (Sub-)millimeter wave
      spectrum analysis.
PG  - 244301
LID - 10.1063/5.0095242 [doi]
AB  - The (sub-)millimeter wave spectrum of the non-rigid CH2OH radical is investigated
      both experimentally and theoretically. Ab initio calculations are carried out to 
      quantitatively characterize its potential energy surface as a function of the two
      large amplitude angleH1COH and angleH2COH dihedral angles. It is shown that the
      radical displays a large amplitude torsional-like motion of its CH2 group with
      respect to the OH group. The rotation-torsion levels computed with the help of a 
      4D Hamiltonian accounting for this torsional-like motion and for the overall
      rotation exhibit a tunneling splitting, in agreement with recent experimental
      investigations, and a strong rotational dependence of this tunneling splitting on
      the rotational quantum number Ka due to the rotation-torsion Coriolis coupling.
      Based on an internal axis method approach, a fitting Hamiltonian accounting for
      tunneling effects and for the fine and hyperfine structure is built and applied
      to the fitting of the new (sub)-millimeter wave transitions measured in this work
      along with previously available high-resolution data. 778 frequencies and
      wavenumbers are reproduced with a unitless standard deviation of 0.79 using 27
      parameters. The N = 0 tunneling splitting, which could not be determined
      unambiguously in the previous high-resolution investigations, is determined based
      on its rotational dependence.

TI  - Combined effects of voluntary running and liraglutide on glucose homeostasis,
      fatty acid composition of brown adipose tissue phospholipids, and white adipose
      tissue browning in db/db mice.
PG  - 117-124
LID - 10.4103/cjp.cjp_87_21 [doi]
AB  - There is a potential therapeutic application targeting brown adipose tissue
      (BAT). Either voluntary running or liraglutide increases the thermogenesis of BAT
      in type 2 diabetes mellitus, but their combined effect is not yet clarified. Male
      leptin receptor-deficient db/db diabetic mice (n = 24) were randomly divided into
      voluntary running, liraglutide, voluntary running + liraglutide, and control
      groups (n = 6/group). Normal male C57 mice were the negative control (n = 6).
      Fasting blood glucose was monitored every week, plasma insulin and lipid profiles
      were analyzed, and thermogenic protein expression in BAT and white adipose tissue
      (WAT) were analyzed by the western blot. A total of 128 metabolites associated
      with phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, sphingomyelins, and
      ceramides were targeted in BAT. Compared to the control group, voluntary running 
      or liraglutide treatment significantly lowered the blood glucose and increased
      the insulin level; the combined group showed a better effect than liraglutide
      alone. Hence, the combined treatment showed an enhanced hypoglycemic effect.
      Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and OXPHOS protein expression in BAT and UCP1 in WAT 
      were significantly increased after exercise training and liraglutide treatment.
      However, BAT metabolomics showed that compared to the control mice, nine fatty
      acids increased in the exercise group, six increased in the liraglutide group,
      and only three increased in the combined group. These results may suggest a
      higher hypoglycemic effect and the activation of BAT and WAT browning in the
      combined group.

AB  - A critical component of conserving and housing species ex situ is an explicit
      scientific understanding of the physiological underpinnings of their welfare.
      Cortisol has been repeatedly linked to stress, and therefore used as an indicator
      of welfare for many species. In order to measure cortisol in the Livingstone's
      fruit bat (Pteropus livingstonii; a critically endangered keystone species)
      without disturbing the captive population, we have developed and validated a
      non-invasive, novel hormone extraction procedure and faecal glucocorticoid assay.
      A total of 92 faecal samples, 73 from the P. livingstonii breeding colony at
      Jersey Zoo, Channel Islands and 19 samples from P. livingstonii housed at Bristol
      Zoological Gardens, UK, have been collected and analyzed. Mixed-effect modelling 
      of the influence of physiological state variables on cortisol concentration
      revealed that lactating females had higher cortisol levels than non-lactating
      females, indicating that our assay is measuring biologically relevant hormone
      concentrations. Males and older bats also had higher cortisol than non-lactating 
      females and younger individuals. Further analysis applied social network
      methodology to compare the cortisol levels of bats with different social roles.
      We found that individuals that linked social groups possessed higher than average
      cortisol levels and conversely, individuals with high-quality, positive
      relationships had lower cortisol levels. These results demonstrate, for the first
      time in a bat species, social mediation of stress hormones. Lastly, the frequency
      of vocalisation was found to positively correlate with cortisol concentration in 
      males, suggesting that this behaviour may be used by animal management as a
      visual indicator of a bat's hormonal status. Hence, this research has provided
      unique insights and empirical scientific knowledge regarding the relationship
      between the physiology and social behaviour of P. livingstonii, therefore
      allowing for recommendations to be made to optimise bat welfare at the individual
      level.

TI  - Contemporary management of isolated free fluid on computed tomography scan in
      blunt abdominal trauma-experience from a Level 1 trauma centre in New Zealand.
PG  - 28-37
AB  - AIMS: The management of patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) who have
      isolated free fluid (IFF) with no solid organ injury (SOI) on computed tomography
      (CT) remains controversial. This study aims to determine if the volume of free
      fluid (FF) is a predictor of the need for operative management of traumatic
      intra-abdominal injuries, by reviewing the local cumulative experience with IFF
      at a major trauma centre in New Zealand. METHODS: A retrospective study was
      undertaken over nine years at a Level 1 trauma centre in New Zealand. Patients
      aged over 15 years who sustained BAT and had IFF with no SOI demonstrated on CT
      were included. All CT scans and patient notes were reviewed. The volume of free
      fluid was classified by the local interpreting radiologist on the CT report.
      RESULTS: Eighty-two out of 1,177 BAT patients (7%) had IFF with no SOI on CT.
      Thirty-eight percent were males, with a median age of 31 years. Nineteen (23%)
      underwent immediate operative management (OM) at the time of presentation. The
      remaining 63 patients had a trial of non-operative management (NOM), 10 (16%) of 
      which were unsuccessful and required an operation. Overall, 29 patients (35%)
      required operative management. Eighty-nine percent of the OM group and 90% who
      failed NOM had positive operative findings, giving an overall true positive of
      32%. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IFF in itself is not an absolute indication for
      operative exploration and many patients with trace IFF can be managed
      non-operatively. Small amounts of IFF should be regarded with suspicion, and
      moderate or large amounts of fluid are likely to require operative exploration.
      Further work must make use of clinical scoring systems and laparoscopy or
      laparotomy to assess patients at high risk of surgically remediable
      intra-abdominal injury post BAT.

AB  - Mass cytometry allows for the use of highly multiplexed antibody panels due to
      the lack of spill-over between channels detected by mass spectrometry. An
      advantage over fluorescence cytometry is the relative lack of background, which
      provides excellent resolution for detection of phosphoproteins and quantification
      of cell signaling. We have applied mass cytometry to the analysis of whole blood 
      staining after ex vivo stimulation with peanut allergen (Tordesillas et al., J
      Allergy Clin Immunol 138:1741-4.e9, 2016). This allows for high-dimensional
      analysis of basophil activation, and analysis of the entire composition of the
      blood compartment in response to allergen exposure. Here, we describe our
      optimized protocol for activation and staining of whole blood for mass cytometry 
      analysis that is currently in use in multicenter clinical trials. The protocol
      can be easily adopted to analyze blood leukocytes in other diseases, including
      asthma.

AB  - Bats are important hosts of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential, including
      filoviruses, MERS-Coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV -1, and likely SARS-CoV-2. Viral
      infection and transmission among wildlife are dependent on a combination of
      factors that include host ecology and immunology, life history traits, roosting
      habitats, biogeography, and external stressors. Between 2016 and 2018, four
      species of insectivorous bats from a readily accessed roadside cave and buildings
      in Ethiopia were sampled and tested for viruses using consensus PCR assays for
      five viral families/genera. Previously identified and novel coronaviruses and
      paramyxoviruses were identified in 99 of the 589 sampled bats. Bats sampled from 
      the cave site were more likely to test positive for a CoV than bats sampled from 
      buildings; viral shedding was more common in the wet season; and rectal swabs
      were the most common sample type to test positive. A previously undescribed
      alphacoronavirus was detected in two bat species from different taxonomic
      families, sampling interfaces, geographic locations, and years. These findings
      expand knowledge of the range and diversity of coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses 
      in insectivorous bats in Ethiopia and reinforce that an improved understanding of
      viral diversity and species-specific shedding dynamics is important for designing
      informed zoonotic disease surveillance and spillover risk reduction efforts.

TI  - Urban affinity and its associated traits: A global analysis of bats.
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16320 [doi]
AB  - Urbanization is a major contributor to the loss of biodiversity. Its rapid
      progress is mostly at the expense of natural ecosystems and the species
      inhabiting them. While some species can adjust quickly and thrive in cities, many
      others cannot. To support biodiversity conservation and guide management
      decisions in urban areas, it is important to find robust methods to estimate the 
      urban affinity of species (i.e. their tendency to live in urban areas) and
      understand how it is associated with their traits. Since previous studies mainly 
      relied on discrete classifications of species' urban affinity, often involving
      inconsistent assessments or variable parameters, their results were difficult to 
      compare. To address this issue, we developed and evaluated a set of continuous
      indices that quantify species' urban affinity based on publicly available
      occurrence data. We investigated the extent to which a species' position along
      the urban affinity gradient depends on the chosen index and how this choice
      affects inferences about the relationship between urban affinity and a set of
      morphological, sensory and functional traits. While these indices are applicable 
      to a wide range of taxonomic groups, we examined their performance using a global
      set of 356 bat species. As bats vary in sensitivity to anthropogenic
      disturbances, they provide an interesting case study. We found that different
      types of indices resulted in different rankings of species on the urban affinity 
      spectrum, but this had little effect on the association of traits with urban
      affinity. Our results suggest that bat species predisposed to urban life are
      characterized by low echolocation call frequencies, relatively long call
      durations, small body size and flexibility in the selection of the roost type. We
      conclude that simple indices are appropriate and practical, and propose to apply 
      them to more taxa to improve our understanding of how urbanization favours or
      filters species with particular traits.

TI  - Cross-Species Transmission of Bat Coronaviruses in the Americas: Contrasting
      Patterns between Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus.
PG  - e0141122
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01411-22 [doi]
AB  - Bats harbor the largest number of coronavirus (CoV) species among mammals,
      serving as major reservoirs of alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, which can jump between bat
      species or to different mammalian hosts, including humans. Bat-CoV diversity is
      correlated with host taxonomic diversity, with the highest number of CoV species 
      found in areas with the highest levels of bat species richness. Although the
      Americas harbor a unique and distinctive CoV diversity, no cross-species
      transmission (CST) or phylogeographic analysis has yet been performed. This study
      analyzes a large sequence data set from across the Americas through a Bayesian
      framework to understand how codivergence and cross-species transmission have
      shaped long-term bat-CoV evolution and ultimately identify bat hosts and regions 
      where the risk of CST is the highest. Substantial levels of CST were found only
      among alphaCoVs. In contrast, cospeciation prevailed along the evolution of
      betaCoVs. Brazil is the center of diversification for both alpha and betaCoVs,
      with the highest levels of bat species richness. The bat family Phyllostomidae
      has played a key role in the evolution of American bat-CoVs, supported by the
      highest values of host transition rates. Although the conclusions drawn from this
      study are supported by biological/ecological evidence, it is likely that novel
      lineages will be discovered, which could also reveal undetected CSTs given that
      sequences are available from 11 of the 35 countries encompassing the Americas.
      The findings of this study can be useful for conducting targeted discovery of
      bat-CoVs in the region, especially in countries of the Americas with no reported 
      sequences. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a strong zoonotic potential due
      to their high rates of evolvability and their capacity for overcoming
      host-specific barriers. Bats harbor the largest number of CoV species among
      mammals, with the highest CoV diversity found in areas with the highest levels of
      bat species richness. Understanding their origin and patterns of cross-species
      transmission is crucial for pandemic preparedness. This study aims to understand 
      how bat-CoVs diversify in the Americas, circulate among and transmit between bat 
      families and genera, and ultimately identify bat hosts and regions where the risk
      of CoV spillover is the highest.

TI  - SASDL and RBATQ: Sparse Autoencoder With Swarm Based Deep Learning and
      Reinforcement Based Q-Learning for EEG Classification.
PG  - 58-68
LID - 10.1109/OJEMB.2022.3161837 [doi]
AB  - The most vital information about the electrical activities of the brain can be
      obtained with the help of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. It is quite a
      powerful tool to analyze the neural activities of the brain and various
      neurological disorders like epilepsy, schizophrenia, sleep related disorders,
      parkinson disease etc. can be investigated well with the help of EEG signals.
      Goal: In this paper, two versatile deep learning methods are proposed for the
      efficient classification of epilepsy and schizophrenia from EEG datasets.
      Methods: The main advantage of using deep learning when compared to other machine
      learning algorithms is that it has the capability to accomplish feature
      engineering on its own. Swarm intelligence is also a highly useful technique to
      solve a wide range of real-world, complex, and non-linear problems. Therefore,
      taking advantage of these factors, the first method proposed is a Sparse
      Autoencoder (SAE) with swarm based deep learning method and it is named as
      (SASDL) using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique, Cuckoo Search
      Optimization (CSO) technique and Bat Algorithm (BA) technique; and the second
      technique proposed is the Reinforcement Learning based on Bidirectional
      Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Attention Mechanism, Tree LSTM and Q learning,
      and it is named as (RBATQ) technique. Results and Conclusions: Both these two
      novel deep learning techniques are tested on epilepsy and schizophrenia EEG
      datasets and the results are analyzed comprehensively, and a good classification 
      accuracy of more than 93% is obtained for all the datasets.

      COVID-19 emergence.
PG  - veac046
LID - 10.1093/ve/veac046 [doi]
AB  - Over the last several decades, no emerging virus has had a profound impact on the
      world as the SARS-CoV-2 that emerged at the end of 2019 has done. To know where
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from and 
      how it jumped into human population, we immediately started a surveillance
      investigation in wild mammals in and around Wuhan when we determined the agent.
      Herein, coronaviruses were screened in the lung, liver, and intestinal tissue
      samples from fifteen raccoon dogs, seven Siberian weasels, three hog badgers, and
      three Reeves's muntjacs collected in Wuhan and 334 bats collected around Wuhan.
      Consequently, eight alphacoronaviruses were identified in raccoon dogs, while
      nine betacoronaviruses were found in bats. Notably, the newly discovered
      alphacoronaviruses shared a high whole-genome sequence similarity (97.9 per cent)
      with the canine coronavirus (CCoV) strain 2020/7 sampled from domestic dog in the
      UK. Some betacoronaviruses identified here were closely related to previously
      known bat SARS-CoV-related viruses sampled from Hubei province and its neighbors,
      while the remaining betacoronaviruses exhibited a close evolutionary relationship
      with SARS-CoV-related bat viruses in the RdRp gene tree and clustered together
      with SARS-CoV-2-related bat coronaviruses in the M, N and S gene trees, but with 
      relatively low similarity. Additionally, these newly discovered betacoronaviruses
      seem unlikely to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 because of the deletions in
      the two key regions of their receptor-binding motifs. Finally, we did not find
      SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor virus in these animal samples. Due to the high
      circulation of CCoVs in raccoon dogs in Wuhan, more scientific efforts are
      warranted to better understand their diversity and evolution in China and the
      possibility of a potential human agent.

PG  - 868267
LID - 10.3389/falgy.2022.868267 [doi]
AB  - Many clinical lab settings still use 0.35 KUA/L as the cut-off for serum
      specific-IgE (sIgE) immunoassays, while the detection limit is 0.1 KUA/L. The
      clinical relevance of -low-level sIgE (0.1-0.35 KUA/L) remains controversial. Pru
      p 3 sIgE is considered to be the main routine tool for assessing lipid transfer
      protein (LTP) sensitization. We aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of Pru p
      3 sIgE low levels in a population diagnosed with LTP allergy. Adults diagnosed
      with LTP allergy and Pru p 3 sIgE >/= 0.1 KUA/L between 2012 and 2019 were
      included. Clinical data were reviewed. nPru p 3 basophil activation test (BAT)
      was performed and basophil reactivity (BR) and sensitivity (BS) correlated with
      the peach allergy symptoms. Pru p 3 sIgE from 496 subjects was recorded, 114
      (23.0%) between 0.1 and 0.34 KUA/L (grLOW), the rest >/= 0.35 KUA/L (grB). A
      total of 44.7% in grLOW and 59.9% in grB were allergic. Urticaria was more
      frequent in grLOW. In grLOW, Pru p 3 sIgE was higher in patients with local
      compared with systemic symptoms. In grB, Pru p 3 sIgE was higher in allergic
      patients. Pru p 3/Total IgE ratios were higher in allergic vs. tolerant in both
      groups. In BAT, BR was similar in both groups. In grLOW, it was higher on
      allergic compared with tolerant (p = 0.0286), and on those having systemic vs.
      local symptoms (p = 0.0286). BS showed no significant difference between groups. 
      Patients with low levels represent a non-negligible fraction and around 45% are
      peach allergic. BAT showed functional sIgE in them. Pru p 3 sensitizations should
      be carefully evaluated even when sIgE levels are low.

TI  - Utility of the Basophil Activation Test Using Gly m 4, Gly m 5 and Gly m 6
      Molecular Allergens for Characterizing Anaphylactic Reactions to Soy.
PG  - 908435
LID - 10.3389/falgy.2022.908435 [doi]
AB  - There are two major clinically described forms of IgE-dependent soy allergy: (i) 
      a primary dietary form, linked to sensitization against soy storage proteins Gly 
      m 5 and Glym 6, and (ii) a form included in birch-soy syndromes linked to Gly m
      4, a PR-10-like allergen. This second form sometimes causes severe systemic
      reactions, even anaphylaxis, especially on consuming certain forms of soy such as
      soymilks or smoothies. Skin prick tests and specific IgE assays against soy whole
      extracts lack sensitivity. Assays of anti-Gly m 4, Gly m 5 and Gly m 6 specific
      IgEs have been developed to overcome this obstacle, but they unfortunately lack
      specificity, especially for anti-Gly m 4. We hypothesized that the basophil
      activation test (BAT) using molecular soy allergens Gly m 4, Gly m 5 and Gly m 6 
      would both remedy the lack of sensitivity of other tests and offer, through its
      mechanistic contribution, greater specificity than the assay of anti-Gly m 4
      specific IgEs. This would enable the two types of soy allergy to be separately
      identified. In a characteristic clinical example of PR-10-induced anaphylactic
      reaction after consuming soymilk, we report preliminary results of Gly m
      4-exclusive positivity of BAT supporting our hypothesis. It will be necessary to 
      confirm these results on more patients in subsequent studies, and to specify the 
      place of the BAT in an overall diagnostic strategy. Meanwhile, soy BAT using
      molecular allergens is a promising diagnostic tool for soy allergy and probably
      also for follow-up in specific immunotherapies.

AB  - Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed significant
      problems for patients who have undergone total laryngectomy (TL). The lack of
      specific guidelines and paucity of information available to the public on this
      topic has clearly emerged during the ongoing pandemic. The aim of the present
      study is to investigate our personal experience in managing the stoma in TL
      patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A questionnaire was administered 
      by phone to laryngectomised patients who had previously been seen at the
      outpatient otolaryngology clinics of Vittorio Veneto and Barletta Hospitals from 
      January to December 2020. Results: A total of 92 patients were included.
      Twenty-five patients (27%) had been tested for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 19 (76%) 
      had been investigated with a nasal swab, 5 (20%) with a tracheal swab and 1 with 
      a serological assay. Five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (in 4 cases as a 
      result of the nasal swab, in one case with the bronchial aspirate). Eighty-four
      patients (91%) used a heat moisture exchanger over the stoma every day, but 6
      patients (6.5%) were unaware of the importance of protecting the stoma.
      Conclusions: We conclude that TL patients should always be adequately informed by
      healthcare staff about how to manage their stoma. Specific guidelines are needed 
      for testing TL patients for SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Supplementation of diet with Brazil nut modulates body composition, bone
      parameters, and lipid peroxidation in Wistar rats.
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14294 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress, adipose tissue, and bone compartments can be disturbed in
      chronic diseases. Non-pharmacological strategies, such as Brazil nuts (BNs), can 
      improve these parameters. This study evaluated the effects of BN supplementation 
      at different concentrations on body composition, lipid profile, and peroxidation 
      in healthy rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control (CT),
      Brazil nut 5% (BN5), and Brazil nut 10% (BN10) groups. Body composition, brown
      adipose tissue (BAT), plasma lipid peroxidation, and lipid profile were evaluated
      in the three groups. The BN5 group showed an improvement in all bone parameters
      compared with that of the CT group (p < .0001). The BN5 and BN10 groups showed
      reduced plasma lipid peroxidation compared with that of the CT group (p = .0009),
      whereas the BN10 group presented lower BAT lipid peroxidation than that of the
      other groups (p = .01). High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels were 
      higher in the BN5 group than in the CT group (p = .01). Conclusively, the use of 
      BNs in a controlled manner promoted improvement in bone parameters, HDL-c levels,
      and lipid peroxidation in healthy rats. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Nuts has been
      included in the diet because of their versatility, acceptance, and easy access.
      Among them, Brazil nut (BN) is considered one of the major known food sources of 
      selenium as well as a source of fibers, unsaturated fatty acids, and phenolic
      compounds. Studies have shown that BN supplementation is effective in reducing
      oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid peroxidation, and selenium deficiency when 
      used as a non-pharmacological strategy in experimental models of chronic diseases
      and in clinical trials. The present study showed that controlled administration
      of BN improved bone parameters, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and 
      lipid peroxidation in healthy rats. Therefore, BN is a promising
      non-pharmacological agent for the prevention of the onset of chronic
      non-communicable diseases.

TI  - Bats actively modulate membrane compliance to control camber and reduce drag.
LID - jeb243974 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.243974 [doi]
AB  - Bat wing skin is exceptionally compliant and cambers significantly during flight.
      Plagiopatagiales proprii, arrays of small muscles embedded in the armwing
      membrane, are activated during flight and are hypothesized to modulate membrane
      tension. We examined the function of these muscles using Jamaican fruit bats,
      Artibeus jamaicensis. When these muscles were paralyzed using botulinum toxin,
      the bats preferred flight speed decreased and they were unable to fly at very low
      speeds. Paralysis of the plagiopatagiales also resulted in increased armwing
      camber consistent with a hypothesized role of modulating aeroelastic
      interactions. Other compensatory kinematics included increased downstroke angle
      and increased wingbeat amplitude. These results are consistent with the bats
      experiencing increased drag and flight power costs associated with the loss of
      wing-membrane control. Our results indicate that A. jamaicensis likely always
      employ their wing membrane muscles during sustained flight to control camber and 
      to enhance flight efficiency over a wide flight envelope.

TI  - Non-invasive auditory brainstem responses to FM sweeps in awake big brown bats.
PG  - 505-516
LID - 10.1007/s00359-022-01559-w [doi]
AB  - We introduce two EEG techniques, one based on conventional monopolar electrodes
      and one based on a novel tripolar electrode, to record for the first time
      auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) from the scalp of unanesthetized,
      unrestrained big brown bats. Stimuli were frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps varying
      in sweep direction, sweep duration, and harmonic structure. As expected from
      previous invasive ABR recordings, upward-sweeping FM signals evoked larger
      amplitude responses (peak-to-trough amplitude in the latency range of 3-5 ms
      post-stimulus onset) than downward-sweeping FM signals. Scalp-recorded responses 
      displayed amplitude-latency trading effects as expected from invasive recordings.
      These two findings validate the reliability of our noninvasive recording
      techniques. The feasibility of recording noninvasively in unanesthetized,
      unrestrained bats will energize future research uncovering electrophysiological
      signatures of perceptual and cognitive processing of biosonar signals in these
      animals, and allows for better comparison with ABR data from echolocating
      cetaceans, where invasive experiments are heavily restricted.

AB  - Obesity induces chronic inflammation resulting in insulin resistance and
      metabolic disorders. Cold exposure can improve insulin sensitivity in humans and 
      rodents, but the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we find that
      cold resolves obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance and improves
      glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice. The beneficial effects of cold
      exposure on improving obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance depend 
      on brown adipose tissue (BAT) and liver. Using targeted liquid chromatography
      with tandem mass spectrometry, we discovered that cold and beta3-adrenergic
      stimulation promote BAT to produce maresin 2 (MaR2), a member of the specialized 
      pro-resolving mediators of bioactive lipids that play a role in the resolution of
      inflammation. Notably, MaR2 reduces inflammation in obesity in part by targeting 
      macrophages in the liver. Thus, BAT-derived MaR2 could contribute to the
      beneficial effects of BAT activation in resolving obesity-induced inflammation
      and may inform therapeutic approaches to combat obesity and its complications.

AB  - Fine audiovocal control is a hallmark of human speech production and depends on
      precisely coordinated muscle activity guided by sensory feedback. Little is known
      about shared audiovocal mechanisms between humans and other mammals. We
      hypothesized that real-time audiovocal control in bat echolocation uses the same 
      computational principles as human speech. To test the prediction of this
      hypothesis, we applied state feedback control (SFC) theory to the analysis of
      call frequency adjustments in the echolocating bat, Hipposideros armiger. This
      model organism exhibits well-developed audiovocal control to sense its
      surroundings via echolocation. Our experimental paradigm was analogous to one
      implemented in human subjects. We measured the bats' vocal responses to
      spectrally altered echolocation calls. Individual bats exhibited highly distinct 
      patterns of vocal compensation to these altered calls. Our findings mirror
      typical observations of speech control in humans listening to spectrally altered 
      speech. Using mathematical modeling, we determined that the same computational
      principles of SFC apply to bat echolocation and human speech, confirming the
      prediction of our hypothesis.

TI  - Recombinant vesicular stomatitis vaccine against Nipah virus has a favorable
      safety profile: Model for assessment of live vaccines with neurotropic potential.
PG  - e1010658
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010658 [doi]
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) disease is a bat-borne zoonosis responsible for outbreaks with 
      high lethality and is a priority for vaccine development. With funding from the
      Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), we are developing a
      chimeric vaccine (PHV02) composed of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
      expressing the envelope glycoproteins of both Ebola virus (EBOV) and NiV. The
      EBOV glycoprotein (GP) mediates fusion and viral entry and the NiV attachment
      glycoprotein (G) is a ligand for cell receptors, and stimulates neutralizing
      antibody, the putative mediator of protection against NiV. PHV02 is identical in 
      construction to the registered Ebola vaccine (Ervebo) with the addition of the
      NiV G gene. NiV ephrin B2 and B3 receptors are expressed on neural cells and the 
      wild-type NiV is neurotropic and causes encephalitis in affected patients. It was
      therefore important to assess whether the NiV G alters tropism of the rVSV vector
      and serves as a virulence factor. PHV02 was fully attenuated in adult hamsters
      inoculated by the intramuscular (IM) route, whereas parental wild-type VSV was
      100% lethal. Two rodent models (mice, hamsters) were infected by the
      intracerebral (IC) route with graded doses of PHV02. Comparator active controls
      in various experiments included rVSV-EBOV (representative of Ebola vaccine) and
      yellow fever (YF) 17DD commercial vaccine. These studies showed PHV02 to be more 
      neurovirulent than both rVSV-EBOV and YF 17DD in infant animals. PHV02 was lethal
      for adult hamsters inoculated IC but not for adult mice. In contrast YF 17DD
      retained virulence for adult mice inoculated IC but was not virulent for adult
      hamsters. Because of the inconsistency of neurovirulence patterns in the rodent
      models, a monkey neurovirulence test (MNVT) was performed, using YF 17DD as the
      active comparator because it has a well-established profile of quantifiable
      microscopic changes in brain centers and a known reporting rate of neurotropic
      adverse events in humans. In the MNVT PHV02 was significantly less neurovirulent 
      than the YF 17DD vaccine reference control, indicating that the vaccine will have
      an acceptable safety profile for humans. The findings are important because they 
      illustrate the complexities of phenotypic assessment of novel viral vectors with 
      tissue tropisms determined by transgenic proteins, and because it is
      unprecedented to use a heterologous comparator virus (YF vaccine) in a
      regulatory-enabling study. This approach may have value in future studies of
      other novel viral vectors.

AB  - The use of natural products for medicinal purposes is becoming more and more
      common nowadays, as evidenced by the presence in plants of secondary metabolites 
      with different potentials such as antioxidant and antibacterial properties. We
      evaluated in this work the antimicrobial activities of the extracts and some
      isolated compounds from the seeds of Psychotria succulenta Hiern. (Rubiaceae), a 
      Cameroonian medicinal plant traditionally used to cure microbial infections. The 
      ethanol extract was prepared by maceration and extracted with ethyl acetate and
      n-butanol. The EtOAc (m = 168 g) and n-BuOH (m = 20 g) extracts were further
      fractionated by silica gel column chromatography to isolation of compounds. Their
      structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and by comparison with
      published data. The antibacterial activity of extracts and compounds was assessed
      by evaluating the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal
      concentration (MBC) against pathogenic bacteria. Thirteen compounds including
      four alkaloids (veprisine (1), naucleofficine III (2), vepridimerine B (3), and
      vepridimerine C (4)), three triterpenes (barbinervic acid (5),
      3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl quinovic acid (6), and oleanolic acid (7)), one
      steroid (beta-sitosterol-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (8)), four phenolic compounds
      (scopoletin (9), gallic acid (10), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (11), and
      kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (12)), and
      one iridoid (borreriagenin (13)) were isolated from the EtOAc and n-BuOH
      extracts. These compounds were identified by 1D and 2D NMR combined analysis as
      well as by melting point comparison. The EtOH, EtOAc, and n-BuOH extracts
      exhibited significant antibacterial activities (MIC = 32-128 mug/mL; MBC = 64-256
      mug/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium), Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumonia (Gram-negative bacteria). 
      Among the isolated compounds, scopoletin (9) showed a moderate activity against
      Klebsiella pneumoniae with MIC and MBC values of 16 mug/mL and 32 mug/mL,
      respectively. It appears that, chemotaxonomically, some of the isolated compounds
      have already been obtained from the genus Psychotria but to the best of our
      knowledge, this is the first report on the phytochemical investigation of P.
      succulenta. Although many other studies need to be achieved, our results support 
      the use of P. succulenta in traditional medicine to cure infectious diseases
      particularly those caused by the tested bacteria.

AB  - Obesity has become a global epidemic, and it is a major risk factor for other
      metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic disease.
      Accumulating evidence indicates that there is sex-specific metabolic protection
      and disease susceptibility. For instance, in both clinical and experimental
      studies, males are more likely to develop obesity, insulin resistance, and
      diabetes. In line with this, males tend to have more visceral white adipose
      tissue (WAT) and less brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity, both
      leading to an increased incidence of metabolic disorders. This female-specific
      fat distribution is partially mediated by sex hormone estrogens. Specifically,
      hypothalamic estrogen signaling plays a vital role in regulating WAT
      distribution, WAT beiging, and BAT thermogenesis. These regulatory effects on
      adipose tissue metabolism are primarily mediated by the activation of estrogen
      receptor alpha (ERalpha) in neurons, which interacts with hormones and adipokines
      such as leptin, ghrelin, and insulin. This review discusses the contribution of
      adipose tissue dysfunction to obesity and the role of hypothalamic estrogen
      signaling in preventing metabolic diseases with a particular focus on the VMH,
      the central regulator of energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis.

TI  - Severe Hyperprolactinemia Promotes Brown Adipose Tissue Whitening and Aggravates 
      High Fat Diet Induced Metabolic Imbalance.
PG  - 883092
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.883092 [doi]
AB  - Background: The association of high serum prolactin and increased body weight is 
      positive but controversial, therefore we hypothesized that additional factors
      such as diets and the impact of prolactin on brown adipose tissue may condition
      its metabolic effects. Methods: We used LacDrd2KO females with lifelong severe
      hyperprolactinemia due dopamine-D2 receptor deletion from lactotropes, and slow
      onset of metabolic disturbances, and compared them to their respective controls
      (Drd2 (loxP/loxP) ). Food intake, and binge eating was evaluated. We then
      challenged mice with a High Fat (HFD) or a Control Diet (CD) for 8 weeks,
      beginning at 3 months of age, when no differences in body weight are found
      between genotypes. At the end of the protocol brown and white adipose tissues
      were weighed, and thermogenic and lipogenic markers studied, using real time PCR 
      (Ucp1, Cidea, Pgc1a, Lpl, adiponectin, Prlr) or immunohistochemistry (UCP1).
      Histochemical analysis of brown adipose tissue, and glucose tolerance tests were 
      performed. Results: Hyperprolactinemic mice had increased food intake and binge
      eating behavior. Metabolic effects induced by a HFD were exacerbated in lacDrd2KO
      mice. Hyperprolactinemia aggravated HFD-induced body weight gain and glucose
      intolerance. In brown adipose tissue pronounced cellular whitening as well as
      decreased expression of the thermogenic markers Ucp1 and Pgc1a were observed in
      response to high prolactin levels, regardless of the diet, and furthermore,
      hyperprolactinemia potentiated the decrease in Cidea mRNA expression induced by
      HFD. In subcutaneous white adipose tissue hyperprolactinemia synergistically
      increased tissue weight, while decreasing Prlr, Adiponectin and Lpl mRNA levels
      regardless of the diet. Conclusions: Pathological hyperprolactinemia has a strong
      impact in brown adipose tissue, lowering thermogenic markers and evoking tissue
      whitening. Furthermore, it modifies lipogenic markers in subcutaneous white
      adipose, and aggravates HFD-induced glucose intolerance and Cidea decrease.
      Therefore, severe high prolactin levels may target BAT function, and furthermore 
      represent an adjuvant player in the development of obesity induced by high fat
      diets.

PG  - 781972
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2021.781972 [doi]
AB  - Behavior therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) aims to reduce avoidance,
      rituals, and discomfort in OCD-relevant situations. The Behavioral Avoidance Test
      (BAT) measures these behavior-related outcomes in individually challenging
      OCD-related situations. The association of the BAT with OCD severity measures and
      its relevance for treatment outcome is, however, still unclear. The current study
      investigates with a retrospective analysis of a subsample of a pilot study, (1)
      if reactions on the BAT are related to OCD severity measures in an OCD sample (n 
      = 28), (2) if treatment with two variants of cognitive-behavior therapy (exposure
      and response prevention vs. metacognitive therapy) changes the BAT scores and (3)
      if these changes as well as pretreatment BAT avoidance are relevant for OCD
      treatment outcome as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
      (Y-BOCS). Participants rated avoidance, ritual, and discomfort in three
      individually challenging OCD-related situations before and after therapy. For one
      of these situations, BAT dimensions were rated by the therapist and an
      independent rater in addition to the patients' ratings. Correlational analyses
      found significant correlations between BAT discomfort and OCD severity measures
      like the Y-BOCS. A repeated measures ANOVA with pre- and posttest scores showed
      that all three BAT dimensions significantly decreased during both treatments.
      Hierarchical regression analyses (controlling for Y-BOCS pretest scores) revealed
      that changes in BAT discomfort as well as pretreatment BAT avoidance scores
      predicted the Y-BOCS posttest score. These findings suggest that the BAT is a
      distinct measure of behavior-related outcomes partly being relevant for OCD
      treatment outcome.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has a role in maintaining systemic metabolic health in
      rodents and humans. Here, we show that metabolic stress induces BAT to produce
      coagulation factors, which then-together with molecules derived from the
      circulation-promote BAT dysfunction and systemic glucose intolerance. When mice
      were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), the levels of tissue factor, coagulation Factor
      VII (FVII), activated coagulation Factor X (FXa), and protease-activated receptor
      1 (PAR1) expression increased significantly in BAT. Genetic or pharmacological
      suppression of coagulation factor-PAR1 signaling in BAT ameliorated its whitening
      and improved thermogenic response and systemic glucose intolerance in mice with
      dietary obesity. Conversely, the activation of coagulation factor-PAR1 signaling 
      in BAT caused mitochondrial dysfunction in brown adipocytes and systemic glucose 
      intolerance in mice fed normal chow. These results indicate that BAT produces
      endogenous coagulation factors that mediate pleiotropic effects via PAR1
      signaling under metabolic stress.

AB  - Atmospheric nuclear tests (1945-1980) have led to radioactive fallout across the 
      globe. French tests in Polynesia (1966-1974) may influence the signature of
      fallout in South America in addition to those conducted by USA and former USSR
      until 1963 in the Northern hemisphere. Here, we compiled the (240)Pu/(239)Pu atom
      ratios reported for soils of South America and conducted additional measurements 
      to examine their latitudinal distributions across this continent. Significantly
      lower ratio values were found in the 20-45 degrees latitudinal band (0.04 to
      0.13) compared to the rest of the continent (up to 0.20) and attributed to the
      contribution of the French atmospheric tests to the ultra-trace plutonium levels 
      found in these soils. Based on sediment cores collected in lakes of Chile and
      Uruguay, we show the added value of measuring (240)Pu/(239)Pu atom ratios to
      refine the age models of environmental archives in this region of the world.

AB  - Research and media attention is disproportionately focused on taxa and ecosystems
      perceived as charismatic, while other equally diverse systems such as caves and
      subterranean ecosystems are often neglected in biodiversity assessments and
      prioritisations. Highlighting the urgent need for protection, an especially large
      fraction of cave endemic species may be undescribed. Yet these more challenging
      systems are also vulnerable, with karsts for example losing a considerable
      proportion of their area each year. Bats are keystone to cave ecosystems making
      them potential surrogates to understand cave diversity patterns and identify
      conservation priorities. On a global scale, almost half (48 %) of known bat
      species use caves for parts of their life histories, with 32 % endemic to a
      single country, and 15 % currently threatened. We combined global analysis of
      cave bats from the IUCN spatial data with site-specific analysis of 1930 bat
      caves from 46 countries to develop global priorities for the conservation of the 
      most vulnerable subterranean ecosystems. Globally, 28 % of caves showed high bat 
      diversity and were highly threatened. The highest regional concentration of
      conservation priority caves was in the Palearctic and tropical regions (except
      the Afrotropical, which requires more intensive cave data sampling). Our results 
      further highlight the importance of prioritising bat caves by incorporating
      locally collected data and optimising parameter selection (i.e., appropriate
      landscape features and threats). Finally, to protect and conserve these
      ecosystems it is crucial that we use frameworks such as this to identify
      priorities in species and habitat-level and map vulnerable underground habitats
      with the highest biodiversity and distinctiveness.

TI  - The different effects of intramuscularly-injected lactate on white and brown
      adipose tissue in vivo.
LID - 10.1007/s11033-022-07672-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactate is an important product of glycolysis metabolism during
      exercise and has long been recognized as an important metabolic signaling
      molecule involved in inhibiting lipolysis and promoting lipogenesis, which
      consequently leads to regulated adipose tissue metabolism. However, recent
      studies have shown that lactate promotes the browning of white adipose tissue
      (WAT), which induces heat production and energy expenditure and ultimately causes
      weight loss. These studies assessing the effects of lactate on lipid metabolism
      in adipose tissue have revealed conflicting data, making it an important area
      worthy of further research. METHODS: In this study, using intramuscular injection
      of lactate to the gastrocnemius, we identified the role of lactate treatment on
      lipid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis of white adipose tissue and brown
      adipose tissue (BAT). RESULTS: Our results showed that lactate treatment
      activated the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and promoted the expression of
      lipolysis-related proteins (AMPK, HSL, ATGL) and mitochondrial biomarkers
      (PGC-1alpha, COXIV) of WAT, while BAT showed an opposite trend after lactate
      treatment. Further studies showed that lactate treatment significantly increased 
      serum epinephrine and promoted beta3-AR protein expression in WAT and
      significantly decreased in BAT. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that lactate seems to
      regulate beta3-adrenergic receptors differently in WAT and BAT, thereby eliciting
      disparate responses in adipose tissue.

TI  - Brown adipose tissue activation with ginsenoside compound K ameliorates
      polycystic ovary syndrome.
LID - 10.1111/bph.15909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic
      and endocrine disease affecting women of reproductive age. Due to its complex
      aetiology, there is no currently effective cure for PCOS. Brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) activity is significantly decreased in PCOS patients, and BAT activation
      has beneficial effects in animal models of PCOS. Here, we investigated the effect
      of ginsenoside compound K (CK) in an animal model of PCOS and its mechanism of
      BAT activation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Primary brown adipocytes, Db/Db mice and
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS rats were used. The core body
      temperature, oxygen consumption, energy metabolism related gene and protein
      expression were assessed to identify the effect of CK on overall energy
      metabolism. Oestrous cycle, serum sex hormone, ovarian steroidogenic enzyme gene 
      expression and ovarian morphology were also evaluated following CK treatment. KEY
      RESULTS: Our results indicated that CK treatment could significantly protect
      against body weight gain in Db/Db mice via BAT activation. Furthermore, we found 
      that CK treatment could normalize hyperandrogenism, oestrous cyclicity, normalize
      steroidogenic enzyme expression and decrease the number of cystic follicles in
      PCOS rats. Interestingly, as a potential endocrine intermediate, C-X-C motif
      chemokine ligand-14 protein (CXCL14) was significantly up-regulated following CK 
      administration. In addition, exogenous CXC14 supplementation was found to reverse
      DHEA-induced PCOS in a phenotypically similar manner to CK treatment. CONCLUSION 
      AND IMPLICATIONS: In summary, CK treatment significantly activates BAT, increases
      CXCL14 expression and ameliorates PCOS. These findings suggest that CK might be a
      potential drug candidate for PCOS treatment.

TI  - Latitudinal gradients in biotic interactions: are cacti pollination systems more 
      specialised in the tropics?
LID - 10.1111/plb.13450 [doi]
AB  - Biotic interactions are said to be more specialised in the tropics, and this was 
      also proposed for the pollination systems of columnar cacti from North America.
      However, it has not yet been tested for a wider set of cactus species. Here, we
      use the available information about pollination in the Cactaceae to explore the
      geographic patterns of this mutualistic interaction, and test if there is a
      latitudinal gradient in its degree of specialisation. We performed a
      bibliographic search of all publications on the pollination of cacti species and 
      summarized the information to build a database. We used generalised linear models
      to evaluate if the degree of specialisation in cacti pollination systems is
      affected by latitude, using two different measures: the number of pollinator
      guilds (functional specialisation) and the number of pollinator species
      (ecological specialisation). Our database contained information about the
      pollination of 148 species. The most frequent pollinator guilds were bees, birds,
      moths and bats. There was no apparent effect of latitude on the number of guilds 
      that pollinate a cactus species. However, latitude had a small but significant
      effect on the number of pollinator species that services a given cactus species. 
      Bees are found as pollinators of most cactus species, along a wide latitudinal
      gradient. Bat and bird pollination is more common in the tropics than in the
      extra-tropics. The available information suggests that cacti pollination systems 
      are slightly more ecologically specialised in the tropics, but it does not
      support any trend with regard to functional specialisation.

AB  - Lysosomal storage diseases result in various developmental and physiological
      complications, including cachexia. To study the causes for the negative energy
      balance associated with cachexia, we assessed the impact of sulfamidase
      deficiency and heparan sulfate storage on energy homeostasis and metabolism in a 
      mouse model of Type IIIa mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS IIIa, Sanfilippo A syndrome).
      At 12 weeks of age, MPS IIIa mice exhibited fasting and postprandial
      hypertriglyceridemia compared to wild-type mice, with a reduction of white and
      brown adipose tissue depots. Partitioning of dietary [(3)H]triolein showed a
      marked increase in intestinal uptake and secretion, whereas hepatic production
      and clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins did not differ from wild-type
      controls. Uptake of dietary triolein was also elevated in brown adipose tissue
      (BAT), and notable increases in beige adipose tissue occurred, resulting in
      hyperthermia, hyperphagia, hyperdipsia, and increased energy expenditure.
      Furthermore, fasted MPS IIIa mice remained hyperthermic when subjected to low
      temperature, but became cachexic and profoundly hypothermic when treated with a
      lipolytic inhibitor. We demonstrated the reliance on increased lipid fueling of
      BAT was driven by a reduced ability to generate energy from stored lipids within 
      the depot. These alterations arose from impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion,
      resulting in increased mitochondria content in beige and BAT. Finally, we show
      the increased mitochondria content in BAT and postprandial dyslipidemia was
      partially reversed upon a 5-week treatment with recombinant sulfamidase. We
      hypothesize that increased BAT activity and persistent increases in energy demand
      in MPS IIIa mice contribute to the negative energy balance observed in MPS IIIa
      patients.

AB  - Most patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) to vespid venoms present
      double sensitization by specific IgE (sIgE)-mediated cross-reactivity. Thus, it
      is mandatory could discriminate between a true double and primary sensitization
      to implement an accurate venom-specific immunotherapy (VIT). To date,
      CAP-inhibition is the reference method in the diagnosis of cross-reactivity in
      double sensitized patients to vespid venoms, being the results obtained with the 
      component resolved diagnostics (CRD) conflicting. For this, we have studied in a 
      cohort of double sensitized patients to Vespula vulgaris (VV) and Polistes
      dominulus (PD) venoms (n = 40) the diagnostic accuracy of CRD using the
      CAP-inhibition as reference method, as well as to investigate whether basophil
      activation test (BAT) is an alternative method for inconclusive results obtained 
      by CAP-inhibition. CAP-inhibition showed a sensitivity of 59.46 % in view of the 
      indeterminate results; most patients had true double sensitization (54.5 %),
      followed by single sensitization to PD (27.27 %) and VV (18.18 %) venoms. CRD
      based on rVes v 5/rPol d 5 (or vice versa) ratio as well as whole extracts I3/I77
      (or vice versa) ratio (specific IgE-I3 to VV/specific IgE-I77 to PD) showed a low
      diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.504, p = 0.974; AUC = 0.35, p = 0.235;
      respectively). BAT was determined in parallel with CAP-inhibition in 12 patients,
      presented higher sensitivity than CAP-inhibition (p = 0.021) and a positive
      agreement of 71.43 %. Likewise it was able to identify 100% of inconclusive
      results, showing a specificity of 83.3 %. Therefore, CRD is not a suitable method
      to distinguish monosensitization and BAT appears to be an appropriate method
      resolving indeterminate results from the gold standard method.

AB  - The preventive effects of regular exercise on obesity-related health problems are
      carried over to the non-exercise detraining period, even when physical activity
      decreases with aging. However, it remains unknown whether regular childhood
      exercises can be carried over to adulthood. Therefore, this study aimed to
      investigate the effects of long-term childhood exercise and detraining on lipid
      accumulation in organs to prevent obesity in adulthood. Four-week-old male Otsuka
      Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were used as obese animals. OLETF rats
      were allocated into sedentary and exercise groups: exercise from 4- to
      12-week-old and detraining from 12- to 20-week-old. At 12-week-old immediately
      after the exercise period, regular exercise completely inhibited hyperphagia,
      obesity, enlarged pancreatic islets, lipid accumulation and lobular inflammation 
      in the liver, hypertrophied adipocytes in the white adipose tissue (WAT), and
      brown adipose tissue (BAT) whitening in OLETF rats. Additionally, exercise
      attenuated the decrease in the ratio of muscle wet weight to body weight
      associated with obesity. Decreased food consumption was maintained during the
      detraining period, which inhibited obesity and diabetes at 20-week-old after the 
      detraining period. Histologically, childhood exercise inhibited the enlargement
      of pancreatic islets after the detraining period. In addition, inhibition of
      lipid accumulation was completely maintained in the WAT and BAT after the
      detraining period. However, the effectiveness was only partially successful in
      lipid accumulation and inflammation in the liver. The ratio of muscle wet weight 
      to body weight was maintained after detraining. In conclusion, early long-term
      regular exercise effectively prevents obesity and diabetes in childhood, and its 
      effectiveness can be tracked later in life. The present study suggests the
      importance of exercise during childhood and adolescence to inhibit
      hyperphagia-induced lipid accumulation in metabolic-related organs in adulthood
      despite exercise cessation.

AB  - Most bat species have highly developed audio-vocal systems, which allow them to
      adjust the features of echolocation calls that are optimized for different sonar 
      tasks, such as detecting, localizing, discriminating and tracking targets.
      Furthermore, bats can also produce a wide array of social calls to communicate
      with conspecifics. The acoustic properties of some social calls differ only
      subtly from echolocation calls, yet bats have the ability to distinguish them and
      reliably produce appropriate behavioral responses. Little is known about the
      underlying neural processes that enable the correct classification of bat social 
      communication sounds. One approach to this question is to identify the brain
      regions that are involved in the processing of sounds that carry behavioral
      relevance. Here, we present preliminary data on neuronal activation, as measured 
      by c-fos expression, in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) exposed to either
      social calls, echolocation calls or kept in silence. We focused our investigation
      on five relevant brain areas; three within the canonical auditory pathway
      (auditory cortex, inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body) and two that
      are involved in the processing of emotive stimulus content (amygdala and nucleus 
      accumbens). In this manuscript we report c-fos staining of the areas of interest 
      after exposure to conspecific calls. We discuss future work designed to overcome 
      experimental limitations and explore whether c-fos staining reveals anatomical
      segregation of neurons activated by echolocation and social call categories.

TI  - Histopathologic and Immunohistochemical Evaluation of Induced Lesions, Tissue
      Tropism and Host Responses following Experimental Infection of Egyptian Rousette 
      Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) with the Zoonotic Paramyxovirus, Sosuga Virus.

AB  - Ecological and experimental infection studies have identified Egyptian rousette
      bats (ERBs; Rousettus aegyptiacus: family Pteropodidae) as a reservoir host for
      the zoonotic rubula-like paramyxovirus Sosuga virus (SOSV). A serial sacrifice
      study of colony-bred ERBs inoculated with wild-type, recombinant SOSV identified 
      small intestines and salivary gland as major sites of viral replication. In the
      current study, archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from the 
      serial sacrifice study were analyzed in depth-histologically and
      immunohistochemically, for SOSV, mononuclear phagocytes and T cells.
      Histopathologic lesion scores increased over time and viral antigen persisted in 
      a subset of tissues, indicating ongoing host responses and underscoring the
      possibility of chronic infection. Despite the presence of SOSV NP antigen and
      villus ulcerations in the small intestines, there were only mild increases in
      mononuclear phagocytes and T cells, a host response aligned with disease
      tolerance. In contrast, there was a statistically significant, robust and
      targeted mononuclear phagocyte cell responses in the salivary glands at 21 DPI,
      where viral antigen was sparse. These findings may have broader implications for 
      chiropteran-paramyxovirus interactions, as bats are hypothesized to be the
      ancestral hosts of this diverse virus family and for ERB immunology in general,
      as this species is also the reservoir host for the marburgviruses Marburg virus
      (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV) (family Filoviridae).

TI  - Test Case Prioritization, Selection, and Reduction Using Improved Quantum-Behaved
      Particle Swarm Optimization.
LID - 4374 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22124374 [doi]
AB  - The emerging areas of IoT and sensor networks bring lots of software applications
      on a daily basis. To keep up with the ever-changing expectations of clients and
      the competitive market, the software must be updated. The changes may cause
      unintended consequences, necessitating retesting, i.e., regression testing,
      before being released. The efficiency and efficacy of regression testing
      techniques can be improved with the use of optimization approaches. This paper
      proposes an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization approach for
      regression testing. The algorithm is improved by employing a fix-up mechanism to 
      perform perturbation for the combinatorial TCP problem. Second, the dynamic
      contraction-expansion coefficient is used to accelerate the convergence. It is
      followed by an adaptive test case selection strategy to choose the
      modification-revealing test cases. Finally, the superfluous test cases are
      removed. Furthermore, the algorithm's robustness is analyzed for fault as well as
      statement coverage. The empirical results reveal that the proposed algorithm
      performs better than the Genetic Algorithm, Bat Algorithm, Grey Wolf
      Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization and its variants for prioritizing test 
      cases. The findings show that inclusivity, test selection percentage and cost
      reduction percentages are higher in the case of fault coverage compared to
      statement coverage but at the cost of high fault detection loss (approx. 7%) at
      the test case reduction stage.

TI  - Trichoderma Enzymes for Degradation of Aflatoxin B1 and Ochratoxin A.
LID - 3959 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27123959 [doi]
AB  - The contamination of agricultural products with mycotoxins causes risks to animal
      and human health and severe economic losses. Mycotoxicoses can be reduced by
      preventing fungal infection using chemical and biological approaches. The
      chemical strategies can release toxic molecules; therefore, strategies for
      biological control are being evaluated, such as using nontoxic fungi and their
      metabolites. This work evaluated the effect of exoenzymes produced by the
      beneficial fungus Trichoderma afroharzianum strain T22 in degrading Aflatoxin B1 
      (AFB1) and Ochratoxin A (OTA). The ability of Trichoderma to produce hydrolases
      was stimulated by using different inducing substrates. The highest AFB1 and OTA
      degradation activity was obtained using a medium containing lyophilized mushrooms
      and crude fiber. The T. afroharzianum T22's ability to reduce mycotoxins may be
      attributed to peroxidase enzymes. This study showed that T.afroharzianum strain
      T22 or its peroxidase supplementation could represent a sustainable strategy for 
      the degradation of AFB1 and OTA in feed and food products.

TI  - Viral Hyperparasitism in Bat Ectoparasites: Implications for Pathogen Maintenance
      and Transmission.
LID - 1230 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10061230 [doi]
AB  - Humans continue to encroach on the habitats of wild animals, potentially bringing
      different species into contact that would not typically encounter each other
      under natural circumstances, and forcing them into stressful, suboptimal
      conditions. Stressors from unsustainable human land use changes are suspected to 
      dramatically exacerbate the probability of zoonotic spillover of pathogens from
      their natural reservoir hosts to humans, both by increasing viral load (and
      shedding) and the interface between wildlife with livestock, pets and humans.
      Given their known role as reservoir hosts, bats continue to be investigated for
      their possible role as the origins of many viral outbreaks. However, the
      participation of bat-associated ectoparasites in the spread of potential
      pathogens requires further work to establish. Here, we conducted a comprehensive 
      review of viruses, viral genes and other viral sequences obtained from bat
      ectoparasites from studies over the last four decades. This review summarizes
      research findings of the seven virus families in which these studies have been
      performed, including Paramyxoviridae, Reoviridae, Flaviviridae, Peribunyaviridae,
      Nairoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Filoviridae. We highlight that bat ectoparasites,
      including dipterans and ticks, are often found to have medically important
      viruses and may have a role in the maintenance of these pathogens within bat
      populations.

TI  - DEPP Deficiency Contributes to Browning of White Adipose Tissue.
LID - 6563 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126563 [doi]
AB  - Decidual protein induced by progesterone (DEPP) was originally identified as a
      modulator in the process of decidualization in the endometrium. Here, we define
      that DEPP is involved in adipose tissue thermogenesis, which contributes to
      metabolic regulation. Knockdown of DEPP suppressed adipocyte differentiation and 
      lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells, induced expression of brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) markers in primary brown adipocyte and induced mouse embryonic fibroblasts 
      (MEFs) differentiation to brown adipocytes. Moreover, DEPP deficiency in mice
      induced white adipocyte browning and enhanced BAT activity. Cold exposure
      stimulated more browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and maintained higher body
      temperature in DEPP knockout mice compared to that in wild-type control mice.
      DEPP deficiency also protected mice against high-fat-diet-induced insulin
      resistance. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that DEPP competitively binds SIRT1,
      inhibiting the interaction between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
      gamma (PPARgamma) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Collectively, these findings suggest
      that DEPP plays a crucial role in orchestrating thermogenesis through regulating 
      adipocyte programs and thus might be a potential target for the treatment of
      metabolic disorders.

TI  - Neurosecretory Protein GL Promotes Normotopic Fat Accumulation in Male ICR Mice.
LID - 6488 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126488 [doi]
AB  - Neurosecretory protein GL (NPGL) is a small secretory protein identified in the
      hypothalamus of birds and mammals. We recently reported that NPGL exerts
      obesogenic effects in obesity-prone C57BL6/J mice. However, whether NPGL elicits 
      adiposity in different mouse strains is poorly understood. In this study, we
      generated transgenic mice overexpressing Npgl using the ICR strain (Npgl Tg mice)
      to elucidate the obesogenic effects of NPGL in different strains. Npgl Tg mice
      showed increased white adipose tissue (WAT) mass. Although the mass of brown
      adipose tissue (BAT) was slightly altered in Npgl Tg mice, hypertrophy of lipid
      droplets was also observed in BAT. In contrast, fat accumulation was not induced 
      in the liver, with the upregulation of mRNAs related to hepatic lipolysis. These 
      results support the hypothesis that NPGL causes obesity in several strains and
      species. This report highlights the pivotal role of NPGL in fat accumulation in
      adipose tissues and contributes to the elucidation of the biological mechanisms
      underlying obesity and metabolic diseases in heterogeneous populations.

TI  - Trematodes of Genera Gyrabascus and Parabascus from Bats in European Russia:
      Morphology and Molecular Phylogeny.
LID - 878 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11060878 [doi]
AB  - Morphological variability of trematodes from bats (Chiroptera) is poorly studied.
      Since the variability of adult digenean specimens may be rather high,
      morphological features are often insufficient for the identification of closely
      related species, and confirmation with the use of molecular data is required. The
      aim of our study was to combine the morphological and molecular phylogenetic
      analyses of several bat trematodes from the genera Gyrabascus and Parabascus
      (Pleurogenidae): Gyrabascus amphoraeformis, Gyrabascus oppositus, Parabascus
      lepidotus, Parabascus duboisi, and Parabascus semisquamosus, of which G.
      amphoraeformis and G. oppositus are little known in European Russia. We made
      detailed morphological descriptions of these trematodes from several definitive
      hosts, analyzed morphometric features, and generated new partial sequences of the
      28S rRNA gene. A broad variability of trematodes of the genera Gyrabascus and
      Parabascus was revealed both from various host species and from specimens of the 
      same host species. We propose a new taxonomic key for the identification of the
      studied species. Certain host specificity of these trematodes was revealed.

TI  - Predator-Prey Relationship between Urban Bats and Insects Impacted by Both
      Artificial Light at Night and Spatial Clutter.
LID - 829 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11060829 [doi]
AB  - Predators respond to the increase of prey by aggregation in space or foraging
      more often. However, foraging habitat suitability limits predators' responses.
      For nocturnal insectivorous bats, artificial light at night (ALAN) can trigger
      insect prey aggregation. It is not clear how ALAN might affect predator-prey
      relationships in the urban setting, where urban bats could have adapted to the
      city, and novel spatial complexity introduced by man-made objects might alter
      foraging habitat suitability. We strategically selected sites to represent
      different levels of ALAN and spatial complexity. We recorded bat commuting and
      foraging activities and collected aerial insects to examine how ALAN and spatial 
      complexity affected bat-insect relationships. We found that insect biomass was
      positively correlated with ALAN, but was not affected by spatial complexity.
      Large-sized big brown bats and hoary bats positively responded to change of prey 
      in open sites whereas small-sized eastern red bats and silver-haired bats
      positively responded in cluttered sites, suggesting that the impact of ALAN could
      vary when ALAN is coupled with urban spatial complexity. Our study demonstrates
      that foraging habitat suitability can alter which species might benefit from
      ALAN. Predator-prey relationships in cities are complex, but general ecological
      principles still apply in novel urban ecosystems.

TI  - Harnessing the Potential of Enzymes as Inhaled Therapeutics in Respiratory Tract 
      Diseases: A Review of the Literature.
LID - 1440 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10061440 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory tract diseases (RTDs) are a global cause of mortality and affect
      patient well-being and quality of life. Specifically, there is a high unmet need 
      concerning respiratory tract infections (RTIs) due to limitations of vaccines and
      increased antibiotic resistance. Enzyme therapeutics, and in particular
      plant-based enzymes, represent an underutilised resource in drug development
      warranting further attention. This literature review aims to summarise the
      current state of enzyme therapeutics in medical applications, with a focus on
      their potential to improve outcomes in RTDs, including RTIs. We used a narrative 
      review approach, searching PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov with search terms
      including: enzyme therapeutics, enzyme therapy, inhaled therapeutics, botanical
      enzyme therapeutics, plant enzymes, and herbal extracts. Here, we discuss the
      advantages and challenges of enzyme therapeutics in the setting of RTDs and
      identify and describe several enzyme therapeutics currently used in the
      respiratory field. In addition, the review includes recent developments
      concerning enzyme therapies and plant enzymes in (pre-)clinical stages. The
      global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has sparked development of
      several promising new enzyme therapeutics for use in the respiratory setting, and
      therefore, it is timely to provide a summary of recent developments, particularly
      as these therapeutics may also prove beneficial in other RTDs.

TI  - Functional changes of the gastric bypass microbiota reactivate thermogenic
      adipose tissue and systemic glucose control via intestinal FXR-TGR5 crosstalk in 
      diet-induced obesity.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/s40168-022-01264-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery remains the most effective therapy for adiposity
      reduction and remission of type 2 diabetes. Although different bariatric
      procedures associate with pronounced shifts in the gut microbiota, their
      functional role in the regulation of energetic and metabolic benefits achieved
      with the surgery are not clear. METHODS: To evaluate the causal as well as the
      inherent therapeutic character of the surgery-altered gut microbiome in improved 
      energy and metabolic control in diet-induced obesity, an antibiotic cocktail was 
      used to eliminate the gut microbiota in diet-induced obese rats after gastric
      bypass surgery, and gastric bypass-shaped gut microbiota was transplanted into
      obese littermates. Thorough metabolic profiling was combined with omics
      technologies on samples collected from cecum and plasma to identify adaptions in 
      gut microbiota-host signaling, which control improved energy balance and
      metabolic profile after surgery. RESULTS: In this study, we first demonstrate
      that depletion of the gut microbiota largely reversed the beneficial effects of
      gastric bypass surgery on negative energy balance and improved glucolipid
      metabolism. Further, we show that the gastric bypass-shaped gut microbiota
      reduces adiposity in diet-induced obese recipients by re-activating energy
      expenditure from metabolic active brown adipose tissue. These beneficial effects 
      were linked to improved glucose homeostasis, lipid control, and improved fatty
      liver disease. Mechanistically, these effects were triggered by modulation of
      taurine metabolism by the gastric bypass gut microbiota, fostering an increased
      abundance of intestinal and circulating taurine-conjugated bile acid species. In 
      turn, these bile acids activated gut-restricted FXR and systemic TGR5 signaling
      to stimulate adaptive thermogenesis. CONCLUSION: Our results establish the role
      of the gut microbiome in the weight loss and metabolic success of gastric bypass 
      surgery. We here identify a signaling cascade that entails altered bile acid
      receptor signaling resulting from a collective, hitherto undescribed change in
      the metabolic activity of a cluster of bacteria, thereby readjusting energy
      imbalance and metabolic disease in the obese host. These findings strengthen the 
      rationale for microbiota-targeted strategies to improve and refine current
      therapies of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Video Abstract Bariatric Surgery
      (i.e. RYGB) or the repeated fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from RYGB donors into
      DIO (diet-induced obesity) animals induces shifts in the intestinal microbiome,
      an effect that can be impaired by oral application of antibiotics (ABx). Our
      current study shows that RYGB-dependent alterations in the intestinal microbiome 
      result in an increase in the luminal and systemic pool of Taurine-conjugated Bile
      acids (TCBAs) by various cellular mechanisms acting in the intestine and the
      liver. TCBAs induce signaling via two different receptors, farnesoid X receptor
      (FXR, specifically in the intestines) and the G-protein-coupled bile acid
      receptor TGR5 (systemically), finally resulting in metabolic improvement and
      advanced weight management. BSH, bile salt hydrolase; BAT brown adipose tissue.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although exposure therapy is an efficacious treatment 
      for anxiety disorders, fear often returns after treatment. From an inhibitory
      learning perspective, long-term improvement depends not only on learning that
      feared stimuli are safe, but also that it is safe to experience the emotional
      response triggered by these stimuli. Accordingly, the current study examined the 
      effects of occasional threat reinforcement during repeated exposure to multiple
      cues on the return of fear in snake phobia by incorporating reminders of the
      feared outcome. METHODS: Snake fearful community adults (N = 74) were randomized 
      to either repeated exposure to multiple cues or exposure to multiple cues that
      also explicitly depicted the feared outcome (snake biting someone). A measure of 
      self-reported threat expectancy and a threat-relevant behavioral approach task
      (BAT) were administered pre-exposure, post-exposure, and at a one-week follow-up.
      RESULTS: Compared to the multiple-cue exposure group, the multiple-cue +
      fear-outcome group showed significantly less subjective expectancy for a snake to
      bite and increased behavioral approach of snake images at one-week follow-up. The
      fear-outcome group also reported significantly greater variability in distress
      during exposure than the multiple-cue exposure group and this difference mediated
      the intervention effect on behavioral approach at follow-up. LIMITATIONS:
      Findings are limited by the use of videos as an analogue to exposure and a
      computer-delivered BAT. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest presentation of the
      feared outcome may result in more variability in distress during exposure therapy
      and this may partially explain the maintenance of behavioral gains.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Job burnout is an essential topic for researchers and a
      pressing issue for employers and employees. However, the most popular tool has
      become widely critiqued, and a new measure of burnout - the Burnout Assessment
      Tool (BAT) - is used here. The BAT is helpful because it provides a cut-off
      threshold score representing high burnout risk. This study provides one of the
      first BAT studies post Covid-19 pandemic and focuses on comparing high burnout
      risk rates between essential and non-essential workers after the first lockdown
      in New Zealand (May 2020). METHODS AND RESULTS: Using representative data from
      955 employees across a wide range of occupations, sectors, and industries, we
      calculate an overall burnout risk of 11.1%, with essential workers higher (14%)
      than non-essential workers (9%). The odds ratios of burnout risk and having high 
      levels of mental health complaints were 10-20 times higher for burnout risk
      workers. For essential workers, they were significantly higher for high job
      depression risk (35 times). Building on these results, to develop a deeper
      understanding of the factors contributing to burnout risk, we report on a
      qualitative analysis of comments (n = 213) provided by essential workers on their
      lockdown work experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide evidence that while a
      range of (1) health-related concerns (i.e., increased risk of getting and
      spreading covid) and (2) employee- and employer-specific pressures related to
      challenging lockdown work practices contribute to essential worker burnout risk, 
      an unwavering sense of pride and purpose in the value of their essential work
      serves to reduce this risk. We discuss the implications, highlighting the unique 
      issues facing essential workers.

TI  - Pathogenic Leptospira Species in Bats: Molecular Detection in a Colombian Cave.
LID - 84 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7060084 [doi]
AB  - Leptospirosis is caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., which can be found in
      nature among domestic and wild animals. In Colombia, the Macaregua cave is known 
      for its bat richness; thus, because bats are reservoir hosts of human
      microbiological pathogens, we determined if the Macaregua cave bats harbored
      Leptospira in the wild. A total of 85 kidney samples were collected from three
      bat species (Carollia perspicillata, Mormoops megalophylla, and Natalus
      tumidirostris) to detect Leptospira spp. The 16S rRNA gene was targeted through
      conventional PCR and qPCR; in addition, the LipL32 gene was detected using
      conventional PCR. Obtained amplicons were purified and sequenced for phylogenetic
      analysis. The Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA gene was detected in 51.8% bat kidneys, of
      which 35 sequences were obtained, all clustering within the pathogenic group.
      Moreover, 11 sequences presented high-identity-values with Leptospiranoguchii,
      Leptospiraalexanderi, Leptospiraborgpetersenii, Leptospirakirschneri, and
      Leptospiramayottensis. From the 16S rRNALeptospira spp.-positive population
      samples, 28 amplified for the LipL32 gene, and 23 sequences clustered in five
      different phylogenetic groups. In conclusion, we detected the circulation of
      different groups of Leptospira spp. sequences among cave bats in the wild; some
      sequences were detected in more than one bat specimen from the same species,
      suggesting a conspecific transmission within the cave.

      Fasting.
PG  - 913030
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.913030 [doi]
AB  - Active thermogenic adipocytes avidly consume energy substrates like fatty acids
      and glucose to maintain body temperature upon cold exposure. Despite strong
      evidence for the involvement of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in controlling
      systemic energy homeostasis upon nutrient excess, it is unclear how the activity 
      of brown adipocytes is regulated in times of nutrient scarcity. Therefore, this
      study aimed to scrutinize factors that modulate BAT activity to balance
      thermogenic and energetic needs upon simultaneous fasting and cold stress. For an
      unbiased view, we performed transcriptomic and miRNA sequencing analyses of BAT
      from acutely fasted (24 h) mice under mild cold exposure. Combining these data
      with in-depth bioinformatic analyses and in vitro gain-of-function experiments,
      we define a previously undescribed axis of p53 inducing miR-92a-1-5p
      transcription that is highly upregulated by fasting in thermogenic adipocytes.
      p53, a fasting-responsive transcription factor, was previously shown to control
      genes involved in the thermogenic program and miR-92a-1-5p was found to
      negatively correlate with human BAT activity. Here, we identify fructose
      transporter Slc2a5 as one direct downstream target of this axis and show that
      fructose can be taken up by and metabolized in brown adipocytes. In sum, this
      study delineates a fasting-induced pathway involving p53 that transactivates
      miR-92a-1-5p, which in turn decreases Slc2a5 expression, and suggests fructose as
      an energy substrate in thermogenic adipocytes.

AB  - Many existing protein detection strategies depend on highly functionalized
      antibody reagents. A simpler and easier to produce class of detection reagent is 
      highly desirable. We designed a single-component, recombinant, luminescent
      biosensor that can be expressed in laboratory strains of E. coli and S.
      cerevisiae . This biosensor is deployed in multiple homogenous and immobilized
      assay formats to detect recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen and cultured virus. 
      The chemiluminescent signal generated facilitates detection by an un-augmented
      cell phone camera. B inding A ctivated T andem split-enzyme (BAT) biosensors may 
      serve as a useful template for diagnostics and reagents that detect SARS-CoV-2
      antigens and other proteins of interest.

TI  - The Effects of Maternal Intake of EPA and DHA Enriched Diet During Pregnancy and 
      Lactation on Offspring's Muscle Development and Energy Homeostasis.
PG  - 881624
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.881624 [doi]
AB  - EPA and DHA are n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids with a diversity of
      health benefits on offspring. The objective of this study was to test the in vivo
      effect of maternal ingestion of EPA and DHA on fetal and offspring muscle
      development and energy balance. Two groups of female C57BL/6 mice were fed EPA
      and DHA enriched diet (FA) and diet devoid of EPA and DHA (CON) respectively
      throughout the entire period of gestation and lactation. Embryos at E13 and
      offspring at age of D1 and D21 were selected for sample collection and
      processing. No change in birth number and body weight were observed between
      groups at D1 and D21. Transient increase in the expression levels of myogenesis
      regulating genes was detected at D1 (p < 0.05) in FA group. Most of the
      expression of muscle protein synthesis regulating genes were comparable (p >
      0.05) between FA and CON groups at D1 and D21. The significant increase in MHC4, 
      and IGF-1 was not linked to increased muscle mass. A persistent increase in ISR
      expression (p < 0.05) but not in GLUT-4 (p > 0.05) was detected in offspring.
      Up-regulation of adipogenesis regulating genes was accompanied by increasing
      intramuscular fat accumulation in the offspring of FA group. Considerable
      increase in transcripts of genes regulating lipid catabolism and thermogenesis in
      liver (p < 0.05) was noticed in FA group at D21; whereas, only the levels of
      carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (Cpt1alpha) and Enoyl-CoA Hydratase And
      3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenase (Ehhadh) increased at D1. Similarly, genes
      regulating lipolysis were highly expressed at D21 in FA group. EPA and DHA
      treatment promoted BAT development and activity by increasing the expression of
      BAT signature genes (p < 0.05). Also, maternal intake of EPA and DHA enriched
      diet enhanced browning of sWAT. Taken together, maternal ingestion of EPA/DHA may
      be suggested as a therapeutic option to improve body composition and counteract
      childhood obesity- related metabolic disorders and confer lifelong positive
      metabolic impact on offspring.

TI  - Role of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in the Paediatric Population with
      Blunt Abdominal Trauma: A Prospective Study from a Single Center Experience for
      Paediatric Blunt Abdominal Trauma.
PG  - 44-51
LID - 10.26574/maedica.2022.17.1.44 [doi]
AB  - Aim:The aim of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic ability of
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in pediatric population with history of 
      blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). Materials and methods: In an eight-year period
      (1/2012-1/2020), fifty-nine children (4-14 years old) were transferred to the
      Emergency Department with referred BAT. The initial imaging method was ultrasound
      scan (US). Thirty-two children were discharged in good condition 24 hours after
      their admission. The remaining 27, who had moderate to severe injuries and
      according to their laboratory tests and US results, were evaluated with CEUS and 
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Results:Five children were
      confirmed with splenic injury, two with liver lacerations, one with liver
      lacerations and right kidney contusion, while in nineteen, no visceral pathology 
      was found by US, CEUS and CECT. The CEUS and CECT were in complete agreement. On 
      the contrary, unenhanced-US showed free peritoneal fluid in eleven children and
      possible parenchymal lesions in two children. In two of the patients with
      negative US-study, splenic contusions in CECT and CEUS were revealed. The CEUS
      study was also used as a follow-up method. Among the 27 patients, there were no
      adverse reactions from the CEUS contrast agent either at one-week and six-month
      follow-up, or after one-year period. Conclusion:Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography
      is an effective, easily performed, low cost and radiation free imaging method. It
      is ideal for both initial and follow up evaluation of trauma and thus, we
      encourage its usage in paediatric BAT cases.

AB  - An in-situ study combined with an integrated biomarker response was used to
      evaluate the impact of agricultural effluents in the physiological responses of
      Nile tilapia reared in cages and enclosures of water reservoirs in North Benin.
      Fish were distributed in fish farming systems at two sites: Songhai located
      outside the cotton basin and Batran located in the most productive commune. They 
      were sampled for blood and organs before (BST), during (DST) and after (AST)
      pesticide treatment. Pesticide residues were analysed in water, sediments and
      fish muscles. Several biomarkers were investigated related to the immune
      (peroxidase, lysozyme and complement activities, superoxide anion production) and
      reproductive (sex steroids and vitellogenin levels) responses as well as
      neurotoxicity (cholinesterase activity) and tissue alterations. Biomarkers were
      assessed and analysed via the integrated biomarker response (IBR). The results
      showed that Batran water reservoir was a more harmful ecosystem for fish than
      Songhai one, especially by depressing some immune and reproductive functions in
      relation to a higher-level of pesticide contamination. They also demonstrated
      that the contact of fish to sediments in enclosures aggravated the pesticide
      burden on fish. Therefore, using males as bioindicators would improve the
      sensitivity of the used biomarkers since males seemed more affected than females 
      especially due to pesticide estrogenic induction impacting their reproductive
      system.

TI  - Zaire ebolavirus surveillance near the Bikoro region of the Democratic Republic
      of the Congo during the 2018 outbreak reveals presence of seropositive bats.
PG  - e0010504
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010504 [doi]
AB  - On the 8th of May, 2018, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was declared,
      originating in the Bikoro region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
      near the border with neighboring Republic of the Congo (ROC). Frequent trade and 
      migration occur between DRC and ROC-based communities residing along the Congo
      River. In June 2018, a field team was deployed to determine whether Zaire
      ebolavirus (Ebola virus (EBOV)) was contemporaneously circulating in local bats
      at the human-animal interface in ROC near the Bikoro EVD outbreak. Samples were
      collected from bats in the Cuvette and Likouala departments, ROC, bordering the
      Equateur Province in DRC where the Bikoro EVD outbreak was first detected. EBOV
      genomic material was not detected in bat-derived samples by targeted quantitative
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or by family-level consensus
      polymerase chain reaction; however, serological data suggests recent exposure to 
      EBOV in bats in the region. We collected serum from 144 bats in the Cuvette
      department with 6.9% seropositivity against the EBOV glycoprotein and 14.3%
      seropositivity for serum collected from 27 fruit bats and one Molossinae in the
      Likouala department. We conclude that proactive investment in longitudinal
      sampling for filoviruses at the human-animal interface, coupled with ecological
      investigations are needed to identify EBOV wildlife reservoirs.

TI  - Factors affecting the willingness of mental health staff to get vaccinated
      against COVID-19.
LID - 10.1111/jep.13722 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: At the beginning of vaccination against coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19), information about the effects of the vaccine was not
      known and hesitancy was observed among the population. The mental health staff
      members in our center in Israel had to decide whether to get vaccinated or not.
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences in demographic
      characteristics of vaccinated and nonvaccinated mental health care workers
      (HCWs), and to identify their reasons for or against vaccination. METHOD: Data on
      characteristics of 357 staff members at a mental health center (MHCS) in Israel
      and their attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination, those who were nonvaccinated,
      were collected via anonymous questionnaires, from 1 January to 10 January 2021.
      The groups were then compared using chi(2) , Fisher's exact tests, t test or
      Mann-Whitney nonparametric test as appropriate. A logistic regression was then
      performed using the significant variables and odd ratios presented. RESULTS:
      Eighty-one per cent of the sample received at least the first dose of the
      vaccine. Results indicated differences in seniority (p < 0.001), profession (p < 
      0.001), department (p < 0.001), risk groups (p < 0.05), religion (p < 0.001),
      religiosity (p < 0.001), previous care for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05) and level
      of interaction with patients (p < 0.01), between the vaccinated and nonvaccinated
      staff. The factor that was found to be most influential regarding vaccination and
      which convinced those originally against the vaccine to become vaccinated was the
      level of scientific knowledge about the vaccine. CONCLUSION: Efforts and
      resources should focus on the dissemination of reliable scientific data about the
      vaccine, to increase vaccination rates among mental HCWs.

TI  - Nipah Virus Detection at Bat Roosts after Spillover Events, Bangladesh,
      2012-2019.
PG  - 1384-1392
LID - 10.3201/eid2807.212614 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge of the dynamics and genetic diversity of Nipah virus circulating in
      bats and at the human-animal interface is limited by current sampling efforts,
      which produce few detections of viral RNA. We report a series of investigations
      at Pteropus medius bat roosts identified near the locations of human Nipah cases 
      in Bangladesh during 2012-2019. Pooled bat urine was collected from 23 roosts; 7 
      roosts (30%) had >1 sample in which Nipah RNA was detected from the first visit. 
      In subsequent visits to these 7 roosts, RNA was detected in bat urine up to 52
      days after the presumed exposure of the human case-patient, although the
      probability of detection declined rapidly with time. These results suggest that
      rapidly deployed investigations of Nipah virus shedding from bat roosts near
      human cases could increase the success of viral sequencing compared with
      background surveillance and could enhance understanding of Nipah virus ecology
      and evolution.

TI  - Original Leptospira spp. in island's native terrestrial mammals: A case study in 
      Pteropus spp. bats of New Caledonia.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14635 [doi]
AB  - Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis that occurs in tropical and subtropical
      regions worldwide. Chiroptera are known to be a formidable reservoir of zoonotic 
      pathogens, including leptospires. The epidemiology of leptospirosis in bats in
      the Pacific Islands is poorly known, both in terms of prevalence and in terms of 
      the bacterial strains involved. A strong host specificity between leptospiral
      strains and their mammalian reservoir is recognized. This phenomenon has notably 
      been studied recently in bat communities, providing strong evidence of
      co-evolution. In New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot where leptospirosis is
      endemic and enzootic, Chiroptera are the only indigenous terrestrial mammals. In 
      this study, we aimed to investigate leptospires associated with three flying fox 
      species in New Caledonia. Kidneys and urine samples of Pteropus spp. from
      captures and seizures were analysed. Among 254 flying foxes analysed, 24
      harboured pathogenic leptospires corresponding to an observed prevalence of 9.45%
      with 15.8% on the Main Island and 4.3% on Loyalty Islands. The analysis of the
      rrs gene, lfb1, and MLST sequences evidenced four distinct clusters of
      undescribed strains, likely corresponding to undescribed species. All four
      strains belong to the Group I of pathogenic Leptospira spp., which includes
      Leptospira interrogans, Leptospira noguchii, and Leptospira kirschneri. We
      detected pathogenic leptospires in all three Pteropus spp. studied (including two
      endemic species) with no evidence of host specificity in two co-roosting species.
      For a better understanding of Leptospira-host co-evolution, notably to
      genetically characterize and evaluate the virulence of these original
      bat-associated leptospires, it is essential to improve isolation techniques.
      Flying foxes are traditionally hunted and eaten in New Caledonia, a massive cause
      of bat-human interactions. Our results should encourage vigilance during these
      contacts to limit the spillover risk of these pathogens to humans.

TI  - Exploring the relationship of brown adipose tissue to bone microarchitecture
      using 7T MRI and micro-CT.
PG  - 18481
LID - 10.14670/HH-18-481 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is involved both in energy production and 
      bone metabolism. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship
      between BAT and microarchitecture at cancellous and cortical bone using Kunming
      mice and the methods of 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with
      micro-CT. METHODS: Twenty-four female Kunming mice were examined by 7T MRI and
      measured T2* relaxation time on the deep and superficial interscapular
      BAT?iBAT?and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). Cancellous bone
      microarchitecture of the distal femur and cortical bone of the middle femur were 
      examined by micro-CT. A paired t-test was used to analyze the differences in T2* 
      values between iBAT and sWAT. The correlation between BAT T2* values and bone
      microstructure parameters were analyzed using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: T2*
      values of the deep and superficial iBAT (6.36+/-3.31 ms and 6.23+/-2.61 ms) were 
      significantly shorter than those of sWAT (16.30+/-3.05 ms, tdeep iBAT=-10.816),
      tsuperficial iBAT =-12.276, p<0.01). Deep iBAT T2* values were significantly and 
      negatively correlated with bone volume, cancellous thickness, and bone thickness 
      (Th) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) of the cancellous bone of femur. Deep iBAT 
      T2* values were significantly and positively correlated with the structural model
      index of cancellous bone of femur. Deep iBAT T2* values were significantly and
      negatively correlated with bone mineral density of the cortical bone of femur.
      CONCLUSIONS: MRI can distinguish the two adipose tissues from each other. T2*
      values of BAT were lower than WAT on MRI. BAT related bone remodeling was more
      correlated with the microstructure of cancellous bone than that of cortical bone.

AB  - Background: The emerging viral pandemic worldwide is associated with a novel
      coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This
      virus is said to emerge from its epidemic center in Wuhan, China, in 2019.
      Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded, giant, enveloped RNA viruses that come 
      under the family of coronaviridae and order Nidovirales which are the crucial
      pathogens for humans and other vertebrates. Main body: Coronaviruses are divided 
      into several subfamilies and genera based on the genomic structure and
      phylogenetic relationship. The name corona is raised due to the presence of spike
      protein on the envelope of the virus. The structural and genomic study revealed
      that the total genome size of SARS-CoV-2 is from 29.8 kb to 29.9 kb. The spike
      protein (S) is a glycoprotein that attaches to the receptor of host cells for
      entry into the host cell, followed by the attachment of virus RNA to the host
      ribosome for translation. The phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed the
      similarity (75-88%) with bat SARS-like coronavirus. Conclusion: The sign and
      symptoms of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are also
      discussed in this paper. The worldwide outbreak and prevention from severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 are overviewed in the present article. The
      latest variant of coronavirus and the status of vaccines are also overviewed in
      the present article.

TI  - High genetic diversity of alphacoronaviruses in bat species (Mammalia:
      Chiroptera) from the Atlantic Forest in Brazil.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14636 [doi]
AB  - Bat coronaviruses (Bat-CoVs) represent around 35% of all virus genomes described 
      in bats. Brazil has one of the highest mammal species diversity, with 181 species
      of bats described so far. However, few Bat-CoV surveillance programmes were
      carried out in the country. Thus, our aim was to jevaluate the Bat-CoV diversity 
      in the Atlantic Forest, the second biome with the highest number of bat species
      in Brazil. We analysed 456 oral and rectal swabs and 22 tissue samples from
      Atlantic Forest bats, detecting Alphacoronavirus in 44 swab samples (9.6%)
      targeting the RdRp gene from seven different bat species, three of which have
      never been described as Bat-CoV hosts. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid
      (aa) sequences coding the RdRp gene grouped the sequences obtained in our study
      with Bat-CoV previously detected in identical or congeneric bat species,
      belonging to four subgenera, with high aa identity (over 90%). The RdRp gene was 
      also detected in three tissue samples from Diphylla ecaudata and Sturnira lilium,
      and the partial S gene was successfully sequenced in five tissues and swab
      samples of D. ecaudata. The phylogenetic analysis based on the partial S gene
      obtained here grouped the sequence of D. ecaudata with CoV from Desmodus rotundus
      previously detected in Peru and Brazil, belonging to the Amalacovirus subgenus,
      with aa identity ranging from 73.6% to 88.8%. Our data reinforce the wide
      distribution of Coronaviruses in bats from Brazil and the novelty of three bats
      species as Bat-CoV hosts and the co-circulation of four Alphacoronavirus
      subgenera in Brazil.

TI  - Massive fish death associated with the toxic cyanobacterial Planktothrix sp.
      bloom in the Beni-Haroun Reservoir (Algeria).
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-21538-7 [doi]
AB  - In July 2017, a massive bloom of the potentially toxic cyanobacterial species
      Planktothrix sp. was observed in the Beni-Haroun Reservoir (Algeria), which was
      followed by a massive fish death. Many questions were raised in association with 
      the role of cyanotoxins and the fish massive mortality. The objective of this
      paper is twofold: (1) to investigate the variability of physicochemical and
      cyanobacterial parameters (chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, and
      microcystins) throughout the period of July 2017 to June 2018; and (2) to
      determine the free and total MC levels in viscera and muscle tissues of the
      common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which are found dead in the considered reservoir
      in October 2017. Our results showed microcystin (MC) concentrations in water
      samples (by the protein phosphatase PP2A assay) had reached 651.2 ng MC-LR
      equiv./L. Total MC levels (free + bound) in the viscera and muscle tissues of
      sampled dead fish were at 960.24 and 438.54 microg MC-LR equiv./kg dw,
      respectively. It is assumed that high concentrations of MC observed in the
      tissues of common carp induced a strong degradation of the visceral contents
      resulting in the complete lysis of the hepatopancreas, and presumably the massive
      fish death.

      related coronaviruses.
PG  - 3547

AB  - The origin and host range of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus
      disease 2019 (COVID-19), are important scientific questions as they might provide
      insight into understanding of the potential future spillover to infect humans.
      Here, we tested the binding between equine angiotensin converting enzyme 2
      (eqACE2) and the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2
      prototype (PT) and variant of concerns (VOCs), as well as their close relatives
      bat-origin coronavirus (CoV) RaTG13 and pangolin-origin CoVs GX/P2V/2017 and
      GD/1/2019. We also determined the crystal structures of eqACE2/RaTG13-RBD,
      eqACE2/SARS-CoV-2 PT-RBD and eqACE2/Omicron BA.1-RBD. We identified S494 of
      SARS-COV-2 PT-RBD as an important residue in the eqACE2/SARS-COV-2 PT-RBD
      interaction and found that N501Y, the commonly recognized enhancing mutation,
      attenuated the binding affinity with eqACE2. Our work demonstrates that horses
      are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 and highlights the importance of continuous 
      surveillance on SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs to prevent spillover events.

LID - 10.1088/1748-3190/ac7aff [doi]
AB  - The abilities of certain bat species to navigate in dense vegetation based on
      trains of short biosonar echoes could provide for an alternative, parsimonious
      approach to obtaining the sensory information that is needed to achieve autonomy 
      in complex natural environments. Although bat biosonar has much lower data rates 
      and spatial (angular) resolution than commonly used man-made sensing systems such
      as LiDAR or stereo cameras, bat species that live in dense habitats have the
      ability to reliably detect narrow passageways in foliage. To study the sensory
      information the animals may have available to accomplish this, we have used a
      biomimetic sonar system that was combined with a camera to record echoes and
      synchronized images from ten different field sites that featured narrow
      passageways in foliage. The synchronized camera and sonar data allowed us to
      create a large (130k samples) data set of labeled echoes using a teacher-student 
      approach that used class labels derived from the images to provide training data 
      for training echo-based classifiers. The performance achieved in detecting
      passageways based on the field data closely matched prior results obtained for
      gaps in an artificial foliage set up in the laboratory. With a deep
      feature-extraction neural network (VGG16) a foliage-versus-passageway
      classification accuracy of 96.64%. A transparent AI approach (class-activation
      mapping) indicated that the classifier network relied heavily on the initial
      rising flank of the echoes. This finding could be exploited with a neuromorphic
      echo representation that consisted of times where the echo envelope crossed a
      certain amplitude threshold in a given frequency channel. Whereas a single
      amplitude threshold was sufficient for this in the prior laboratory study,
      multiple thresholds were needed to achieve an accuracy of 92%. These findings
      indicate that despite many sources of variability, clutter echoes from natural
      environments contain sufficient sensory information for detecting passageways in 
      foliage.

LID - 10.1080/10543406.2022.2089155 [doi]
AB  - In early phase oncology drug development, single arm proof-of-concept (POC)
      studies are increasingly being used to drive the early decisions for future
      development of the drug. Decision-makings based on such studies, typically
      involving small sample size and early surrogate efficacy endpoints, are extremely
      challenging. In particular, given the tremendous competition in the development
      of immunotherapies, expedition of the most promising programs is desired. To this
      end, we have proposed a Bayesian three-tier approach to facilitate the
      decision-making process, inheriting all the benefits of Bayesian decision-making 
      approaches and formally allowing the option of acceleration. With pre-specified
      Bayesian decision criteria, three types of decisions regarding the future
      development of the drug can be made: (1) terminating the program, (2) further
      investigation, considering totality of evidence or additional POC studies, and
      (3) accelerating the program. We further proposed a Bayesian adaptive three-tier 
      (BAT) design, extending the decision-making approach to incorporate adaptive
      thresholds and allow for continuous monitoring of the study. We compare the
      performance of the proposed methods with some other existing methods through
      simulations.

AB  - Inhibition of the protein kinase CSNK2 with any of 30 specific and selective
      inhibitors representing different chemotypes, blocked replication of pathogenic
      human, bat, and murine beta-coronaviruses. The potency of in-cell CSNK2A target
      engagement across the set of inhibitors correlated with antiviral activity and
      genetic knockdown confirmed the essential role of the CSNK2 holoenzyme in
      beta-coronavirus replication. Spike protein endocytosis was blocked by CSNK2A
      inhibition, indicating that antiviral activity was due in part to a suppression
      of viral entry. CSNK2A inhibition may be a viable target for the development of
      anti-SARS-like beta-coronavirus drugs.

AB  - The rapid control of a sonar-guided vehicle to pursue a goal while avoiding
      obstacles has been a persistent research topic for decades. Taking into account
      the limited field-of-view of practical sonar systems and vehicle kinematics, we
      propose a neural model for obstacle avoidance that maps the 2-D sensory space
      into a 1-D motor space and evaluates motor actions while combining obstacles and 
      goal information. A two-stage winner-take-all (WTA) mechanism is used to select
      the final steering action. To avoid excessive scanning of the environment, an
      attentional system is proposed to control the directions of sonar pings for
      efficient, task-driven, sensory data collection. A mobile robot was used to test 
      the proposed model navigating through a cluttered environment using a narrow
      field-of-view sonar system. We further propose a spiking neural model using
      spike-timing representations, a spike-latency memory, and a "race-to-first-spike"
      WTA circuit.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The roles and responsibilities of medical physicists (MPs) are
      growing together with the evolving science and technology. The complexity of
      today's clinical trials requires the skills and knowledge of MPs for their safe
      and efficient implementation. However, it is unclear to what extent the skillsets
      offered by MPs are being exploited in clinical trials across Europe. METHODS: The
      EFOMP Working Group on the role of Medical Physics Experts in Clinical Trials has
      designed a survey that targeted all 36 current National Member Organisations,
      receiving a response from 31 countries. The survey included both quantitative and
      qualitative queries regarding the involvement of MPs in trial design, setup, and 
      coordination, either as trial team members or principal investigators. RESULTS:
      The extent of MPs involvement in clinical trials greatly varies across European
      countries. The results showed disparities between the roles played by MPs in
      trial design, conduct or data processing. Similarly, differences among the 31
      European countries that responded to the survey were found regarding the
      existence of national bodies responsible for trials or the available training
      offered to MPs. The role of principal investigator or co-investigator was
      reported by 12 countries (39%), a sign of efficient collaboration with medical
      doctors in designing and implementing clinical studies. CONCLUSION: Organisation 
      of specific training courses and guideline development for clinical trial design 
      and conduct would encourage the involvement of a larger number of MPs in all
      stages of trials across Europe, leading to a better standardisation of clinical
      practice.

AB  - Bats are strictly protected throughout Europe. They are a highly diverse order of
      mammals in terms of body size, body weight, migratory behaviour, trophic niche
      specialisation and habitat use. The latter ranges from urban areas and arable
      land to forest. Due to their low reproductive rate, environmental stressors can
      have a major impact on bat populations. Pesticides in particular are discussed as
      an important driver of bat population declines. In this work, we analysed nearly 
      400 animals of five different species (Eptesicus serotinus, Myotis myotis,
      Nyctalus noctula, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and Plecotus auritus) from all over 
      Germany for residues of 209 pesticides and persistent organic pollutants. Residue
      analysis was conducted with a previously developed method using a miniaturized
      quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) sample preparation and 
      gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for separation and detection. These
      analytical data were statistically correlated with the known data on the animals 
      (e.g. age, sex, place and time of finding). Of 209 pesticides and pollutants
      investigated, 28 compounds were detected, the most frequent being organochlorine 
      insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, which have been banned for decades by
      the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Detection of more
      recent pesticides that were legally used for the last decade included azole
      antifungals and the insecticide fipronil. The bats contained between four and 25 
      different residues. Statistical data analyses showed that the distribution
      throughout Germany is largely comparable, and single exceptions were observed in 
      specialized ecological niches. In conclusion, this work provides the largest
      dataset of pesticide and persistent organic pollutant residues in European bats
      to date.

TI  - Baroreflex activation therapy with the Barostim device in patients with heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction: a patient level meta-analysis of
      randomized controlled trials.
LID - 10.1002/ejhf.2573 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains associated
      with high morbidity and mortality, poor quality of life (QoL) and significant
      exercise limitation. Sympatho-vagal imbalance has been shown to predict adverse
      prognosis and symptoms in HFrEF, yet it has not been specifically targeted by any
      guideline-recommended device therapy to date. Barostim, which directly addresses 
      this imbalance, is the first Food and Drug Administration approved
      neuromodulation technology for HFrEF. We aimed to analyse all randomized trial
      evidence to evaluate the effect of baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) on heart
      failure symptoms, QoL and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in
      HFrEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was
      performed on all eligible trials that randomized HFrEF patients to BAT +
      guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) or GDMT alone (open label). Endpoints
      included 6-month changes in 6-min hall walk (6MHW) distance, Minnesota Living
      With Heart Failure (MLWHF) QoL score, NT-proBNP, and New York Heart Association
      (NYHA) class in all patients and three subgroups. A total of 554 randomized
      patients were included. In all patients, BAT provided significant improvement in 
      6MHW distance of 49 m (95% confidence interval [CI] 33, 64), MLWHF QoL of -13
      points (95% CI -17, -10), and 3.4 higher odds of improving at least one NYHA
      class (95% CI 2.3, 4.9) when comparing from baseline to 6 months. These
      improvements were similar, or better, in patients who had baseline NT-proBNP
      <1600 pg/ml, regardless of the cardiac resynchronization therapy indication
      status. CONCLUSION: An IPD meta-analysis suggests that BAT improves exercise
      capacity, NYHA class, and QoL in HFrEF patients receiving GDMT. These clinically 
      meaningful improvements were consistent across the range of patients studies. BAT
      was also associated with an improvement in NT-proBNP in subjects with a lower
      baseline NT-proBNP.

TI  - Irisin reduces the abnormal reproductive and metabolic phenotypes of PCOS by
      regulating the activity of brown adipose tissue in mice.
LID - ioac125 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/biolre/ioac125 [doi]
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disease in
      women, with clinical manifestations of anovulation and hyperandrogenaemia. The
      treatment of PCOS mainly focuses on improving clinical symptoms, such as insulin 
      sensitivity or menstrual disorder, through drug treatment. However, due to the
      pathogenesis diversity of PCOS, there is still a lack of effective treatment in
      clinics. Metabolic disorder is the key factor in the occurrence of PCOS. Brown
      adipose tissue (BAT) is a special adipose tissue in the human body that can
      participate in metabolic balance by improving heat production. BAT has been
      demonstrated to be an important substance involved in the metabolic disorder of
      PCOS. Although increasing evidence indicates that BAT transplantation can improve
      the symptoms of PCOS, it is difficult to achieve BAT transplantation at present
      due to technical limitations. Stimulation of BAT activation by exogenous
      substances may be an effective alternative therapy for PCOS. In this study, we
      investigated the effects of Irisin on dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS 
      in mice and evaluated the effect of Irisin on serum hormone levels and changes in
      body temperature, body weight and ovarian morphology. In our study, we found that
      Irisin can enhance the thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity of PCOS mice by
      activating the function of BAT. In addition, Irisin treatment can correct the
      menstrual cycle of PCOS mice, improve the serum steroid hormone disorder status, 
      and reduce the formation of ovarian cystic follicles. In conclusion, our results 
      showed that Irisin treatment significantly improved the metabolic disorder of
      PCOS and may provide a new and alternative therapy for the treatment of this
      pathology.

TI  - Increasing African genomic data generation and sharing to resolve rare and
      undiagnosed diseases in Africa: a call-to-action by the H3Africa rare diseases
      working group.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/s13023-022-02391-w [doi]
AB  - The rich and diverse genomics of African populations is significantly
      underrepresented in reference and in disease-associated databases. This renders
      interpreting the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data and reaching a diagnostic 
      more difficult in Africa and for the African diaspora. It increases chances for
      false positives with variants being misclassified as pathogenic due to their
      novelty or rarity. We can increase African genomic data by (1) making consent for
      sharing aggregate frequency data an essential component of research toolkit; (2) 
      encouraging investigators with African data to share available data through
      public resources such as gnomAD, AVGD, ClinVar, DECIPHER and to use MatchMaker
      Exchange; (3) educating African research participants on the meaning and value of
      sharing aggregate frequency data; and (4) increasing funding to scale-up the
      production of African genomic data that will be more representative of the
      geographical and ethno-linguistic variation on the continent. The RDWG of
      H3Africa is hereby calling to action because this underrepresentation accentuates
      the health disparities. Applying the NGS to shorten the diagnostic odyssey or to 
      guide therapeutic options for rare diseases will fully work for Africans only
      when public repositories include sufficient data from African subjects.

AB  - Urban-living wildlife can be exposed to metal contaminants dispersed into the
      environment through industrial, residential, and agricultural applications. Metal
      exposure carries lethal and sublethal consequences for animals; in particular,
      heavy metals (e.g. arsenic, lead, mercury) can damage organs and act as
      carcinogens. Many bat species reside and forage in human-modified habitats and
      could be exposed to contaminants in air, water, and food. We quantified metal
      concentrations in fur samples from three flying fox species (Pteropus fruit bats)
      captured at eight sites in eastern Australia. For subsets of bats, we assessed
      ectoparasite burden, haemoparasite infection, and viral infection, and performed 
      white blood cell differential counts. We examined relationships among metal
      concentrations, environmental predictors (season, land use surrounding capture
      site), and individual predictors (species, sex, age, body condition, parasitism, 
      neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). As expected, bats captured at sites with greater
      human impact had higher metal loads. At one site with seasonal sampling, bats had
      higher metal concentrations in winter than in summer, possibly owing to changes
      in food availability and foraging. Relationships between ectoparasites and metal 
      concentrations were mixed, suggesting multiple causal mechanisms. There was no
      association between overall metal load and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, but
      mercury concentrations were positively correlated with this ratio, which is
      associated with stress in other vertebrate taxa. Comparison of our findings to
      those of previous flying fox studies revealed potentially harmful levels of
      several metals; in particular, endangered spectacled flying foxes (P.
      conspicillatus) exhibited high concentrations of cadmium and lead. Because some
      bats harbor pathogens transmissible to humans and animals, future research should
      explore interactions between metal exposure, immunity, and infection to assess
      consequences for bat and human health.

TI  - Turning-ascending flight of a Hipposideros pratti bat.
PG  - 211788
LID - 10.1098/rsos.211788 [doi]
AB  - Bats exhibit a high degree of agility and provide an excellent model system for
      bioinspired flight. The current study investigates an ascending right turn of a
      Hipposideros pratti bat and elucidates on the kinematic features and aerodynamic 
      mechanisms used to effectuate the manoeuvre. The wing kinematics captured by a
      three-dimensional motion capture system is used as the boundary condition for the
      aerodynamic simulations featuring immersed boundary method. Results indicate that
      the bat uses roll and yaw rotations of the body to different extents
      synergistically to generate the centripetal force to initiate and sustain the
      turn. The turning moments are generated by drawing the wing inside the turn
      closer to the body, by introducing phase lags in force generation between the
      wings and redirecting force production to the outer part of the wing outside of
      the turn. Deceleration in flight speed, an increase in flapping frequency,
      shortening of the upstroke and thrust generation at the end of the upstroke were 
      observed during the ascending manoeuvre. The bat consumes about 0.67 W power to
      execute the turning-ascending manoeuvre, which is approximately two times the
      power consumed by similar bats during level flight. Upon comparison with a
      similar manoeuvre by a Hipposideros armiger bat (Windes et al. 2020 Bioinspir.
      Biomim. 16, abb78d. (doi:10.1088/1748-3190/abb78d)), some commonalities, as well 
      as differences, were observed in the detailed wing kinematics and aerodynamics.

TI  - Demographic characteristics shape patterns of dawn swarming during roost
      switching in tree-dwelling Daubenton's bat.
PG  - 10014
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-14246-2 [doi]
AB  - Frequent roost switching in fission-fusion societies of tree-dwelling bats is
      closely associated with swarming behaviour entailing ritualised night-time
      displays around the roost tree and/or at the roost entrance to signal its actual 
      location, particularly immediately prior to sunrise. However, effects of
      demographic characteristics of individuals in this social behaviour remain
      unanswered. Using passive integrated transponders (PIT) and automatic readers, we
      recorded swarming activity of members of a Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii)
      maternity colony in the vicinity of their roosts. In total, 59,622 activity
      events of 281 PIT-tagged individuals were recorded on ten monitored roosts during
      three summer seasons. We found a gradual increase of swarming activity from
      midnight to sunrise in old adult females, whereas young females and juveniles
      primarily swarmed later at dawn. We attribute this difference to the learning
      status of younger bats, which are not yet able to perform a defined pattern of
      swarming activity, whereas older bats likely take a more active role in
      signalling the position of the roost. Old males exhibited the least swarming
      activity at maternity roosts, which mostly occurred between crepuscular periods, 
      presumably due to their solitary lives. A negative correlation between genetic
      distance and swarming activity suggests an important role of kinship in the
      formation of the maternity colony as well as group cohesion during roost
      switching.

TI  - Tobacco industry's human rights makeover: an archival review of British American 
      Tobacco's human rights rhetorical veneer.
LID - tobaccocontrol-2022-057337 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2022-057337 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: British American Tobacco (BAT) released an industry-first human
      rights report in 2020, which extolled the efforts and objectives of the tobacco
      industry giant for promoting human rights. How BAT came to brand itself as a
      human rights champion, being a leader in an industry long accused of enabling
      human rights violations from leaf-to-stub including profiting from a product
      which inherently violates the right to health, is unknown. Exploring BAT's
      evolution through reviewing its materials and Tobacco Industry Documents could
      shed light on their development and what it means in the tobacco control and
      human rights context. METHODOLOGY: We reviewed publicly available materials from 
      BAT as well as conducted archival research in the Tobacco Industry Documents
      digital archives at University of California San Francisco. We focused on how and
      when BAT used terms such as 'human rights', 'right to health', 'sustainable
      development goal' and 'harm reduction' as well as 'Framework Convention on
      Tobacco Control'. RESULTS: We reviewed 48 BAT publications and 45 documents from 
      the Tobacco Industry Documents archives. These materials demonstrate both BAT's
      increasing utilisation of human rights language as well as BAT's reuse of the
      same language, concepts and general rhetoric. BAT has not engaged significantly
      or meaningfully on the human right to health. CONCLUSION: BAT's increasing use of
      human rights rhetoric does not appear to reflect a shift in the company's human
      rights positions, particularly with respect to the right to health of consumers
      and BAT's lack of impactful measures to eliminate the harms of its tobacco
      products.

TI  - Anti-bat ultrasound production in moths is globally and phylogenetically
      widespread.
PG  - e2117485119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2117485119 [doi]
AB  - Warning signals are well known in the visual system, but rare in other
      modalities. Some moths produce ultrasonic sounds to warn bats of noxious taste or
      to mimic unpalatable models. Here, we report results from a long-term study
      across the globe, assaying moth response to playback of bat echolocation. We
      tested 252 genera, spanning most families of large-bodied moths, and document
      anti-bat ultrasound production in 52 genera, with eight subfamily origins
      described. Based on acoustic analysis of ultrasonic emissions and palatability
      experiments with bats, it seems that acoustic warning and mimicry are the raison 
      d'etre for sound production in most moths. However, some moths use
      high-duty-cycle ultrasound capable of jamming bat sonar. In fact, we find
      preliminary evidence of independent origins of sonar jamming in at least six
      subfamilies. Palatability data indicate that jamming and warning are not mutually
      exclusive strategies. To explore the possible organization of anti-bat warning
      sounds into acoustic mimicry rings, we intensively studied a community of moths
      in Ecuador and, using machine-learning approaches, found five distinct acoustic
      clusters. While these data represent an early understanding of acoustic
      aposematism and mimicry across this megadiverse insect order, it is likely that
      ultrasonically signaling moths comprise one of the largest mimicry complexes on
      earth.

TI  - Structural arrangement of auditory brainstem nuclei in the bats Phyllostomus
      discolor and Carollia perspicillata.
LID - 10.1002/cne.25355 [doi]
AB  - The structure of the mammalian auditory brainstem is evolutionarily highly
      plastic, and distinct nuclei arrange in a species-dependent manner. Such
      anatomical variability is present in the superior olivary complex (SOC) and the
      nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LL). Due to the structure-function relationship 
      in the auditory brainstem, the identification of individual nuclei supports the
      understanding of sound processing. Here, we comparatively describe the nucleus
      arrangement and the expression of functional markers in the auditory brainstem of
      the two bat species Phyllostomus discolor and Carollia perspicillata. Using
      immunofluorescent labeling, we describe the arrangement and identity of the SOC
      and LL nuclei based on the expression of synaptic markers (vesicular glutamate
      transporter 1 and glycine transporter 2), calcium-binding proteins, as well as
      the voltage-gated ion channel subunits Kv1.1 and HCN1. The distribution of
      excitatory and inhibitory synaptic labeling appears similar between both species 
      and matches with that of other mammals. The detection of calcium-binding proteins
      indicates species-dependent differences and deviations from other mammals. Kv1.1 
      and HCN1 show largely the same expression pattern in both species, which diverges
      from other mammals, indicating functional adaptations in the cellular physiology 
      of bat neurons.

      Canadian bat wings.

AB  - Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) is the causative agent of white-nose syndrome, 
      which has resulted in the death of millions of bats in North America (NA) since
      2006. Based on mortalities in eastern NA, the westward spread of infections
      likely poses a significant threat to western NA bats. To help prevent/reduce Pd
      infections in bats in western NA, we isolated bacteria from the wings of wild
      bats and screened for inhibitory activity against Pd. In total, we obtained 1,362
      bacterial isolates from 265 wild bats of 13 species in western Canada. Among the 
      1,362 isolates, 96 showed inhibitory activity against Pd based on a coculture
      assay. The inhibitory activities varied widely among these isolates, ranging from
      slowing fungal growth to complete inhibition. Interestingly, host bats containing
      isolates with anti-Pd activities were widely distributed, with no apparent
      geographic or species-specific pattern. However, characteristics of roosting
      sites and host demography showed significant associations with the isolation of
      anti-Pd bacteria. Specifically, anthropogenic roosts and swabs from young males
      had higher frequencies of anti-Pd bacteria than those from natural roosts and
      those from other sex and age-groups, respectively. These anti-Pd bacteria could
      be potentially used to help mitigate the impact of WNS. Field trials using these 
      as well as additional microbes from future screenings are needed in order to
      determine their effectiveness for the prevention and treatment against WNS.

AB  - Bats are considered reservoirs of many lethal zoonotic viruses and have been
      implicated in several outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as
      SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. It is necessary to systematically derive the 
      expression patterns of bat virus receptors and their regulatory features for
      future research into bat-borne viruses and the prediction and prevention of
      pandemics. Here, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and
      single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing
      (snATAC-seq) of major organ samples collected from Chinese horseshoe bats
      (Rhinolophus affinis) and systematically checked the expression pattern of
      bat-related virus receptors and chromatin accessibility across organs and cell
      types, providing a valuable dataset for studying the nature of infection among
      bat-borne viruses.

AB  - The subgenus Sarbecovirus includes two human viruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
      respectively responsible for the SARS epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic, as well as 
      many bat viruses and two pangolin viruses. Here, the synonymous nucleotide
      composition (SNC) of Sarbecovirus genomes was analysed by examining third
      codon-positions, dinucleotides, and degenerate codons. The results show evidence 
      for the eight following groups: (i) SARS-CoV related coronaviruses (SCoVrC
      including many bat viruses from China), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses
      (SCoV2rC; including five bat viruses from Cambodia, Thailand and Yunnan), (iii)
      pangolin sarbecoviruses, (iv) three bat sarbecoviruses showing evidence of
      recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC genomes, (v) two highly divergent bat
      sarbecoviruses from Yunnan, (vi) the bat sarbecovirus from Japan, (vii) the bat
      sarbecovirus from Bulgaria, and (viii) the bat sarbecovirus from Kenya. All these
      groups can be diagnosed by specific nucleotide compositional features except the 
      one concerned by recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC. In particular, SCoV2rC
      genomes have less cytosines and more uracils at third codon-positions than other 
      sarbecoviruses, whereas the genomes of pangolin sarbecoviruses show more adenines
      at third codon-positions. I suggest that taxonomic differences in the imbalanced 
      nucleotide pools available in host cells during viral replication can explain the
      eight groups of SNC here detected among Sarbecovirus genomes. A related effect
      due to hibernating bats and their latitudinal distribution is also discussed. I
      conclude that the two independent host switches from Rhinolophus bats to
      pangolins resulted in convergent mutational constraints and that SARS-CoV-2
      emerged directly from a horseshoe bat sarbecovirus.

TI  - Triiodothyronine (T3) promotes brown fat hyperplasia via thyroid hormone receptor
      alpha mediated adipocyte progenitor cell proliferation.

AB  - The thyroid hormone (TH)-controlled recruitment process of brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) is not fully understood. Here, we show that long-term treatment of T3, the 
      active form of TH, increases the recruitment of thermogenic capacity in
      interscapular BAT of male mice through hyperplasia by promoting the TH receptor
      alpha-mediated adipocyte progenitor cell proliferation. Our single-cell analysis 
      reveals the heterogeneous nature and hierarchical trajectory within adipocyte
      progenitor cells of interscapular BAT. Further analyses suggest that T3
      facilitates cell state transition from a more stem-like state towards a more
      committed adipogenic state and promotes cell cycle progression towards a mitotic 
      state in adipocyte progenitor cells, through mechanisms involving the action of
      Myc on glycolysis. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying the TH action
      in adipocyte progenitors residing in BAT and provide a framework for better
      understanding of the TH effects on hyperplastic growth and adaptive thermogenesis
      in BAT depot at a single-cell level.

AB  - The linear decrease in the frequency of blue whale songs around the world is, to 
      date, an unexplained phenomenon. We show it can be reproduced by a mathematical
      model considering two antagonistic behavioral trends: first, a bias towards
      conformity in the song, and second, a tendency to try and sing lower than the
      other whales. We check the robustness of our model by considering some more
      complex premises. First, different hierarchical relations between the singers are
      explored, adapting methods used in the flocking motion studies. Then a
      population-dependant simulation shows that even considering the gradual addition 
      of new whales, the evolution is still globally linear. Finally, we show that
      intra-annual variations surging from different causes can be naturally
      incorporated into the model. We then conclude that, unlike other explanations, a 
      cultural hypothesis seems compatible with the observed linearity of the blue
      whales's songs frequency shift.

AB  - Nowadays, microplastics represent emergent pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems
      that exert impacts on soil properties, affecting key soil ecological functions.
      In agroecosystems, plastic mulching is one of the main sources of plastic
      residues in soils. The present research aimed to evaluate the effects of two
      types of plastic sheets (un-biodegradable and biodegradable) on soil abiotic (pH,
      water content, concentrations of organic and total carbon, and total nitrogen)
      and biotic (respiration, and activities of hydrolase, dehydrogenase,
      beta-glucosidase and urease) properties, and on phytotoxicity (germination index 
      of Sorghum saccharatum L. and Lepidium sativum L.). Results revealed that soil
      properties were mostly affected by exposure time to plastics rather than the kind
      (un-biodegradable and biodegradable) of plastics. After six months since mesocosm
      setting up, the presence of un-biodegradable plastic sheets significantly
      decreased soil pH, respiration and dehydrogenase activity and increased total and
      organic carbon concentrations, and toxicity highlighted by S. saccharatum L.
      Instead, the presence of biodegradable plastic sheets significantly decreased
      dehydrogenase activity and increased organic carbon concentrations. An overall
      temporal improvement of the investigated properties in soils covered by
      biodegradable plastic sheets occurred.

TI  - Fever following Covid-19 vaccination in subjects with Brugada syndrome: Incidence
      and management.
LID - 10.1111/jce.15596 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fever is a potential side effect of the Covid-19 vaccination.
      Patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) have an increased risk of life-threatening
      arrhythmias when experiencing fever. Prompt treatment with antipyretic drugs is
      suggested in these patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the incidence and
      management of fever within 48 h from Covid-19 vaccination among BrS patients.
      METHODS: One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients were enrolled in a
      prospective registry involving five European hospitals with a dedicated inherited
      disease ambulatory. RESULTS: The mean age was 50 +/- 14 years and 121 (75%)
      patients were male. Prevalence of Brugada electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern type-1,
      -2, and -3 was 32%, 44%, and 24%, respectively. Twenty-eight (17%) patients had
      an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Fever occurred in 32 (19%) BrS
      patients after 16 +/- 10 h from vaccination, with a peak of body temperature of
      37.9 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees . Patients with fever were younger (39 +/- 13 vs. 48
      +/- 13 years, p = .04). No additional differences in terms of sex and
      cardiovascular risk factors were found between patients with fever and not.
      Twenty-seven (84%) out of 32 patients experienced mild fever and five (16%)
      moderate fever. Pharmacological treatment with antipyretic drugs was required in 
      18 (56%) out of 32 patients and was associated with the resolution of symptoms.
      No patient required hospital admission and no arrhythmic episode was recorded in 
      patients with ICD within 48 h after vaccination. No induced type 1 BrS ECG
      pattern and new ECG features were found among patients with moderate fever.
      CONCLUSION: Fever is a common side effect in BrS patients after the Covid-19
      vaccination. Careful evaluation of body temperature and prompt treatment with
      antipyretic drugs may be needed.

TI  - A review of the circumstances and health-seeking behaviours associated with bat
      exposures in high-income countries.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12980 [doi]
AB  - Human-bat interactions are now the source of the majority of locally acquired
      human lyssavirus infections in many high-income countries without hematophagous
      or 'vampire' bat species. This study aims to identify the most common types and
      circumstances of bat exposures occurring among members of the general public in
      high-income countries with no hematophagous bats, and to describe the
      health-seeking behaviours associated with exposures in these settings. We
      conducted a scoping review of relevant academic and grey literature on bat
      exposures and confirmed bat lyssavirus infections among members of the general
      public in Australia, Canada, the United States and high-income European countries
      from 1996 to 2019. Case studies and population-based studies were included for
      analysis, and findings were extracted and synthesized by the literature type and 
      geographic region. A total of 63 publications were identified, including: 47 case
      studies and 16 population-based studies. Overall, most exposures in Australia and
      Europe were intentionally initiated by humans and involved attempts to handle,
      touch or help a bat. In North America, however, household exposures were more
      common and predominantly involved a bat being found in a room or area where a
      person had slept. Studies also showed that a proportion of bat exposures in
      high-income countries go unreported in the absence of a public health
      investigation and are therefore unlikely to receive prompt treatment. The results
      of this review suggest that the most effective strategies for preventing bat
      exposures vary between regions and that health-seeking behaviours following bat
      exposures could be improved in high-income settings.

TI  - Obligatory homeothermy of mesic habitat-adapted African striped mice, Rhabdomys
      pumilio, is governed by seasonal basal metabolism and year-round 'thermogenic
      readiness' of brown adipose tissue.
LID - jeb243860 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.243860 [doi]
AB  - Small mammals undergo thermoregulatory adjustments in response to changing
      environmental conditions. Whereas small heterothermic mammals can employ torpor
      to save energy in the cold, homeothermic species must increase heat production to
      defend normothermia through the recruitment of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here, 
      we studied thermoregulatory adaptation in an obligate homeotherm, the African
      striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), captured from a subpopulation living in a
      mesic, temperate climate with marked seasonal differences. Basal metabolic rate
      (BMR), non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) and summit metabolic rate (Msum)
      increased from summer to winter, with NST and Msum already reaching maximal rates
      in autumn, suggesting seasonal preparation for the cold. Typical of rodents,
      cold-induced metabolic rates were positively correlated with BAT mass. Analysis
      of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and UCP1 content, however, demonstrated
      that thermogenic capacity declined with BAT mass. This resulted in seasonal
      differences in NST being driven by changes in BMR. The increase in BMR was
      supported by a comprehensive anatomical analysis of metabolically active organs, 
      revealing increased mass proportions in the cold season. The thermoregulatory
      response of R. pumilio was associated with the maintenance of body mass
      throughout the year (48.3+/-1.4 g), contrasting large summer-winter mass
      reductions often observed in Holarctic rodents. Collectively, bioenergetic
      adaptation of this Afrotropical rodent involves seasonal organ adjustments
      influencing BMR, combined with a constant thermogenic capacity dictated by
      trade-offs in the thermogenic properties of BAT. Arguably, this high degree of
      plasticity was a response to unpredictable cold spells throughout the year.
      Consequently, the reliance on such a resource-intensive thermoregulatory strategy
      may expose more energetic vulnerability in changing environments of food scarcity
      and extreme weather conditions due to climate change, with major ramifications
      for survival of the species.

TI  - Imaging Adipose Tissue Browning using Mitochondrial Complex-I Tracer
      [(18)F]BCPP-EF.

AB  - Browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) into beige adipocytes has been proposed as
      a strategy to tackle the ongoing obesity epidemic. Thermogenic stimuli have been 
      investigated with the aim of converting existing white adipose tissue, primarily 
      used for energy storage, into beige adipocytes capable of dissipating energy;
      however, evaluation is complicated by the dearth of noninvasive methodologies to 
      quantify de novo beige adipocytes in WAT. Imaging with [(18)F]FDG is commonly
      used to measure brown adipose tissue (BAT) and beige adipocytes but the
      relationship between beige adipocytes, thermogenesis and [(18)F]FDG uptake is
      unclear. [(18)F]BCPP-EF, a tracer for mitochondrial complex-I (MC-I), acts as a
      marker of oxidative metabolism and may be useful for the detection of newly
      formed beige adipocytes. Mice received doses of the beta3-adrenergic agonist
      CL-316,243 subchronically for 7 days to induce formation of beige adipocytes in
      inguinal white fat. PET imaging was performed longitudinally with both [(18)F]FDG
      (a marker of glycolysis) and [(18)F]BCPP-EF (an MC-I marker) to assess the effect
      of thermogenic stimulation on uptake in browning inguinal WAT and interscapular
      BAT. Treatment with CL-316,243 led to significant increases in both [(18)F]FDG
      and [(18)F]BCPP-EF in inguinal WAT. The uptake of [(18)F]BCPP-EF in inguinal WAT 
      was significantly increased above control levels after 3 days of stimulation,
      whereas [(18)F]FDG only showed a significant increase after 7 days. The uptake of
      [(18)F]BCPP-EF in newly formed beige adipocytes was blocked by pretreatment with 
      an adrenoceptor antagonist suggesting that beige adipocyte formation may be
      associated with the activation of MC-I. However, in BAT, uptake of [(18)F]BCPP-EF
      was unaffected by beta3-adrenergic stimulation, potentially due to the high
      expression of MC-I. [(18)F]BCPP-EF can detect newly formed beige adipocytes in
      WAT generated after subchronic treatment with the beta3-adrenergic agonist
      CL-316,243 and displays both higher inguinal WAT uptake and earlier detection
      than [(18)F]FDG. The MC-I tracer may be a useful tool in the evaluation of new
      therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic adipose tissues to tackle obesity and 
      metabolic diseases.

AB  - Bats are known natural reservoirs of several highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, 
      including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, rabies virus, SARS-like coronaviruses, and
      suspected ancestral reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the ongoing COVID-19
      pandemic. The capacity to survive infections of highly pathogenic agents without 
      severe disease, together with many other unique features, makes bats an ideal
      animal model for studying the regulation of infection, cancer, and longevity,
      which is likely to translate into human health outcomes. A key factor that limits
      bat research is lack of breeding bat colonies. To address this need, a captive
      bat colony was established in Singapore from 19 wild-caught local cave nectar
      bats. The bats were screened for specific pathogens before the start of captive
      breeding. Custom-made cages and an optimized diet inclusive of Wombaroo dietary
      formula, liquid diet, and supplement of fruits enabled the bats to breed
      prolifically in our facility. Cages are washed daily and disinfected once every
      fortnight. Bats are observed daily to detect any sick bat or abnormal behavior.
      In addition, bats undergo a thorough health check once every 3 to 4 mo to check
      on their overall wellbeing, perform sampling, and document any potential
      pregnancy. The current colony houses over 80 bats that are successfully breeding,
      providing a valuable resource for research in Singapore and overseas.

AB  - Prosystemin is a 200-amino acid precursor expressed in Solanaceae plants which
      releases at the C-terminal part a peptidic hormone called Systemin in response to
      wounding and herbivore attack. We recently showed that Prosystemin is not only a 
      mere scaffold of Systemin but, even when deprived of Systemin, is biologically
      active. These results, combined with recent discoveries that Prosystemin is an
      intrinsically disordered protein containing disordered regions within its
      sequence, prompted us to investigate the N-terminal portions of the precursor,
      which contribute to the greatest disorder within the sequence. To this aim,
      PS1-70 and PS1-120 were designed, produced, and structurally and functionally
      characterized. Both the fragments, which maintained their intrinsic disorder,
      were able to induce defense-related genes and to protect tomato plants against
      Botrytis cinerea and Spodoptera littoralis larvae. Intriguingly, the biological
      activity of each of the two N-terminal fragments and of Systemin is similar but
      not quite the same and does not show any toxicity on experimental non-targets
      considered. These regions account for different anti-stress activities conferred 
      to tomato plants by their overexpression. The two N-terminal fragments identified
      in this study may represent new promising tools for sustainable crop protection.

AB  - As a migratory, cryptic, foliage-roosting bat with a mostly solitary roosting
      behavior we have an incomplete understanding of the social behavior of the hoary 
      bat, Lasiurus cinereus. In this species most social interactions between
      conspecifics are thought to involve mating behavior or territorial disputes.
      Developing a more complete understanding of the social behavior of this species
      would provide critical insight to address conservation challenges including high 
      fatality rates from wind turbines during the period of fall migration. We tested 
      the response of hoary bats to conspecific social call playback during the spring 
      and fall migration to: (1) test whether conspecific social call broadcasting
      attracts or repels individual bats; (2) examine whether there are seasonal
      differences in these responses; (3) describe the structure and variation of
      recorded social calls; and (4) test whether conspecific social call playback can 
      increase capture success. Hoary bats were attracted to social call broadcasting
      during both the spring and fall migration. Hoary bats produced social calls
      during the spring and fall migration, and when only males were present,
      suggesting a social function not associated with mating. While calls were
      variable in frequency and length, social calls tended to be a consistent
      upsloping shape. Attraction to social calls suggests social interactions not
      associated with mating behavior in hoary bats, and this technique proved
      successful as an acoustic lure to aid in capture and study of this elusive
      species.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Glycyrrhiza and sargassum are among the 18
      incompatible medicaments according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory. 
      Although it contains glycyrrhiza and sargassum, Haizao Yuhu decoction (HYD) is a 
      classic prescription widely used as TCM to treat goiter. According to the Chinese
      Pharmacopoeia, glycyrrhiza is divided into three varieties: Glycyrrhiza uralensis
      Fish., Glycyrrhiza glabra L., and Glycyrrhiza inflata Bat. Whether the three
      varieties of glycyrrhiza have different efficacy or toxicity when applied in the 
      HYD is unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore whether the HYDs comprising three
      varieties of glycyrrhiza have different efficacy or toxicity when used to treat
      goiter in rats and the underlying mechanisms of these HYDs. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: For two weeks, the goiter model was replicated by intragastric
      propylthiouracil (PTU) administration. Samples were divided into the control
      group, model group, euthyrox group, HYD with glycyrrhiza uralensis (HYD-U) group,
      HYD with glycyrrhiza glabra (HYD-G) group, and HYD with glycyrrhiza inflata
      (HYD-I) group. After four weeks of treatment, body weight, rectal temperature,
      thyroid/liver/kidney coefficient, thyroid/liver/kidney function,
      thyroid/liver/kidney histomorphology, and thyroid ultrastructure were evaluated. 
      Then, real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
      (RTqPCR), Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses were performed to detect 
      genes and proteins affecting autophagy and apoptosis in thyroid cells in the
      AMP-activated Protein Kinases (AMPK)/Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      pathway. RESULTS: All three HYDs increased thyroid hormones (THs) levels,
      relieved thyroid pathological tissue and ultrastructure, and activated vital
      proteins and genes in the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Comparisons among the efficacy of
      the three HYDs indicated that HYD-U restored the THs most effectively; however,
      no difference in the anti-goiter effect was observed. Moreover, the three HYDs
      resulted in no toxicity and promoted the recovery of impaired liver and kidney
      function caused by PTU. Comparisons among the recovery effects of the three HYDs 
      on the liver and kidney were the same. CONCLUSION: Our experiments demonstrated
      that the three HYDs had outstanding anti-goiter effects and protected liver and
      kidney function. Their anti-goiter effects were attributed to AMPK/mTOR
      pathway-induced autophagy and apoptosis. HYD-U resulted in the best THs recovery.
      It was further indicated that in our present study, glycyrrhiza and sargassum
      were compatible in the three HYDs, thereby suggesting their safety of compounding
      in HYD and providing a basis for the research of the 18 incompatible medicaments.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases, especially if caused by bat-borne viruses,
      significantly affect public health and the global economy. There is an urgent
      need to understand the mechanism of interspecies transmission, particularly to
      humans. Viral genetics; host factors, including polymorphisms in the receptors;
      and ecological, environmental, and population dynamics are major parameters to
      consider. Here, we describe the taxonomy, geographic distribution, and unique
      traits of bats associated with their importance as virus reservoirs. Then, we
      summarize the origin, intermediate hosts, and the current understanding of
      interspecies transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2,
      Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, Marburg virus, and rotaviruses. Finally, the molecular
      interactions of viral surface proteins with host cell receptors are examined, and
      a comparison of these interactions in humans, intermediate hosts, and bats is
      conducted. This uncovers adaptive mutations in virus spike protein that
      facilitate cross-species transmission and risk factors associated with the
      emergence of novel viruses from bats.

      genetic variation influences the susceptibility to many viral diseases. However, 
      a variety of challenges have made the implementation of traditional human
      Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) approaches to study these infectious
      outcomes challenging. In contrast, mouse models of infectious diseases provide an
      experimental control and precision, which facilitates analyses and mechanistic
      studies of the role of genetic variation on infection. Here we use a genetic
      mapping cross between two distinct Collaborative Cross mouse strains with respect
      to SARS-CoV disease outcomes. We find several loci control differential disease
      outcome for a variety of traits in the context of SARS-CoV infection.
      Importantly, we identify a locus on mouse Chromosome 9 that shows conserved
      synteny with a human GWAS locus for SARS-CoV-2 severe disease. We follow-up and
      confirm a role for this locus, and identify two candidate genes, CCR9 and CXCR6
      that both play a key role in regulating the severity of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and 
      a distantly related bat sarbecovirus disease outcomes. As such we provide a
      template for using experimental mouse crosses to identify and characterize
      multitrait loci that regulate pathogenic infectious outcomes across species.

TI  - Bat Employs a Conserved MDA5 Gene to Trigger Antiviral Innate Immune Responses.

AB  - Bats are important hosts for various zoonotic viral diseases. However, they
      rarely show signs of disease infection with such viruses. As the first line for
      virus control, the innate immune system of bats attracted our full attention. In 
      this study, the Tadarida brasiliensis MDA5 gene (batMDA5), a major sensor for
      anti-RNA viral infection, was first cloned, and its biological functions in
      antiviral innate immunity were identified. Bioinformatics analysis shows that the
      amino acid sequence of batMDA5 is poorly conserved among species, and it is
      evolutionarily closer to humans. The mRNA of batMDA5 was significantly
      upregulated in Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian influenza virus (AIV), and
      vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-infected bat TB 1 Lu cells. Overexpression of
      batMDA5 could activate IFNbeta and inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP)
      replication in TB 1 Lu cells, while knockdown of batMDA5 yielded the opposite
      result. In addition, we found that the CARD domain was essential for MDA5 to
      activate IFNbeta by constructing MDA5 domain mutant plasmids. These results
      indicated that bat employs a conserved MDA5 gene to trigger anti-RNA virus innate
      immune response. This study helps understand the biological role of MDA5 in
      innate immunity during evolution.

TI  - Clinical Efficacy of Bipolar Androgen Therapy in Men with Metastatic
      Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Combined Tumor-Suppressor Loss.
PG  - 112-115
LID - 10.1016/j.euros.2022.05.006 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) relies on oscillating levels of serum testosterone
      as a way to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC). Aggressive-variant prostate cancers typically require combination
      chemotherapy and are frequently associated with loss-of-function mutations in
      tumor suppressor genes. Here we report clinical outcomes after BAT among patients
      with mCRPC harboring pathogenic alterations in at least two of three genes: TP53,
      PTEN, and RB1. In this setting, BAT induced a meaningful PSA50 response rate,
      progression-free survival and overall survival, particularly in patients without 
      prior chemotherapy. Patient summary: Bipolar androgen therapy, in which drugs are
      used to raise testosterone levels and then allow them to decrease again in a
      cycle, may be a safe and effective treatment for prostate cancer that is
      resistant to testosterone suppression and has mutations in tumor suppressor
      genes. A randomized study comparing this approach to chemotherapy is needed to
      confirm the findings.

AB  - In hepatocytes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha)
      orchestrates a genomic and metabolic response required for homeostasis during
      fasting. This includes the biosynthesis of ketone bodies and of fibroblast growth
      factor 21 (FGF21). Here we show that in the absence of adipose triglyceride
      lipase (ATGL) in adipocytes, ketone body and FGF21 production is impaired upon
      fasting. Liver gene expression analysis highlights a set of fasting-induced genes
      sensitive to both ATGL deletion in adipocytes and PPARalpha deletion in
      hepatocytes. Adipose tissue lipolysis induced by activation of the
      beta3-adrenergic receptor also triggers such PPARalpha-dependent responses not
      only in the liver but also in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Intact PPARalpha
      activity in hepatocytes is required for the cross-talk between adipose tissues
      and the liver during fat mobilization.

AB  - Thiyl radicals offer unique catalytic patterns for the direct covalent activation
      of alkenes. However, important limitations in terms of structural diversity and
      handling have hampered the routine use of thiyl radicals in covalent radical
      catalysis. Herein, we report a new class of cationic sulfur-centered radicals to 
      achieve covalent radical catalysis. Their generation from highly modular
      thioureas by photoredox catalysis make their utilization very simple and
      reliable. The synthetic potential and the versatility of the catalytic system
      were finally evaluated in a (3+2)-radical cascade between vinylcyclopropanes and 
      olefins.

TI  - Patient selection for CAR T or BiTE therapy in multiple myeloma: Which treatment 
      for each patient?
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1186/s13045-022-01296-2 [doi]
AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that affects an increasing
      number of patients worldwide. Despite all the efforts to understand its
      pathogenesis and develop new treatment modalities, MM remains an incurable
      disease. Novel immunotherapies, such as CAR T cell therapy (CAR) and bispecific T
      cell engagers (BiTE), are intensively targeting different surface antigens, such 
      as BMCA, SLAMF7 (CS1), GPRC5D, FCRH5 or CD38. However, stem cell transplantation 
      is still indispensable in transplant-eligible patients. Studies suggest that the 
      early use of immunotherapy may improve outcomes significantly. In this review, we
      summarize the currently available clinical literature on CAR and BiTE in MM.
      Furthermore, we will compare these two T cell-based immunotherapies and discuss
      potential therapeutic approaches to promote development of new clinical trials,
      using T cell-based immunotherapies, even as bridging therapies to a transplant.

TI  - Mafa-dependent GABAergic activity promotes mouse neonatal apneas.
PG  - 3284
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-30825-3 [doi]
AB  - While apneas are associated with multiple pathological and fatal conditions, the 
      underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We report that a mutated form of 
      the transcription factor Mafa (Mafa(4A)) that prevents phosphorylation of the
      Mafa protein leads to an abnormally high incidence of breath holding apneas and
      death in newborn Mafa(4A/4A) mutant mice. This apneic breathing is phenocopied by
      restricting the mutation to central GABAergic inhibitory neurons and by
      activation of inhibitory Mafa neurons while reversed by inhibiting GABAergic
      transmission centrally. We find that Mafa activates the Gad2 promoter in vitro
      and that this activation is enhanced by the mutation that likely results in
      increased inhibitory drives onto target neurons. We also find that Mafa
      inhibitory neurons are absent from respiratory, sensory (primary and secondary)
      and pontine structures but are present in the vicinity of the hypoglossal motor
      nucleus including premotor neurons that innervate the geniohyoid muscle, to
      control upper airway patency. Altogether, our data reveal a role for Mafa
      phosphorylation in regulation of GABAergic drives and suggest a mechanism whereby
      reduced premotor drives to upper airway muscles may cause apneic breathing at
      birth.

TI  - A cocktail of human monoclonal antibodies broadly neutralizes North American
      rabies virus variants as a promising candidate for rabies post-exposure
      prophylaxis.
PG  - 9403
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-13527-0 [doi]
AB  - Human rabies remains a globally significant public health problem. Replacement of
      polyclonal anti-rabies immunoglobulin (RIG), a passive component of rabies
      post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), with a monoclonal antibody (MAb), would
      eliminate the cost and availability constraints associated with RIG. Our team has
      developed and licensed a human monoclonal antibody RAB1 (Rabishield((c))), as the
      replacement for RIG where canine rabies is enzootic. However, for the highly
      diverse rabies viruses of North America, a cocktail containing two or more MAbs
      targeting different antigenic sites of the rabies glycoprotein should be included
      to ensure neutralization of all variants of the virus. In this study, two MAb
      cocktails, R172 (RAB1-RAB2) and R173 (RAB1-CR57), were identified and evaluated
      against a broad range of rabies variants from North America. R173 was found to be
      the most potent cocktail, as it neutralized all the tested North American RABV
      isolates and demonstrated broad coverage of isolates from both terrestrial and
      bat species. R173 could be a promising candidate as an alternative or replacement
      for RIG PEP in North America.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of the Boston Assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury-Lifetime
      Clinical Interview Compared to Department of Defense Medical Records.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since 2006, efforts have been made to increase the accurate
      identification of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in post-9/11 military
      personnel. The Boston Assessment of TBI-Lifetime (BAT-L) is the first validated
      instrument designed specifically to diagnose TBIs throughout the life span in
      post-9/11 Veterans. The objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the
      BAT-L with medical records from the Department of Defense (DoD). MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Traumatic brain injury diagnosis for 153 Veterans deployed in 2011
      enrolled in the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorder
      longitudinal cohort study from the BAT-L clinical interview was compared to DoD
      online medical records to determine diagnostic prevalence and injury severity for
      all head injury cases during deployment. Sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa,
      and Kendall's tau-b were calculated for TBI diagnosis and severity. Concordant
      TBI cases and discordant TBI cases were compared using chi-square and t-test
      analyses. This study has been approved by VA Boston by Institutional Review
      Boards for human participants' protection. RESULTS: Correspondence of TBI
      diagnoses from the BAT-L with DoD records was fair (kappa = 0.42; sensitivity =
      72.7%; specificity = 82.8%). Comparison of injury severity also showed fair
      correspondence (kappa = 0.41). Missing TBI diagnostic data from DoD records were 
      frequent; 43% of TBIs reported on the BAT-L did not have any documentation of
      assessment or diagnoses in DoD records. CONCLUSION: This study addresses a
      critical gap in research by comparing the diagnostic accuracy of a validated,
      semi-structured clinical interview with available medical records. Diagnosis of
      TBIs via the BAT-L was both sensitive and specific when compared to DoD records, 
      supporting the validity of the BAT-L for retrospective assessment of military
      TBI. However, diagnostic correspondence was only fair. This lack of diagnostic
      agreement was related to multiple factors including lack of documentation at the 
      time of injury by DoD, differences in assessment and goals, and other
      combat-related motivational factors associated with failure to report injuries
      while deployed. Several policies have been implemented to address underreporting 
      and under-documentation of TBIs, yet challenges remain. Recommendations for
      evaluating TBI are presented. Accurate diagnosis of TBI is necessary for
      appropriate treatment planning, as well as service-related compensation.

      research questions in animal behavior.

AB  - Animal species differ considerably in longevity. Among mammals, short-lived
      species such as shrews have a maximum lifespan of about a year, whereas
      long-lived species such as whales can live for more than two centuries. Because
      of their slow pace of life, long-lived species are typically of high conservation
      concern and of special scientific interest. This applies not only to large
      mammals such as whales, but also to small-sized bats and mole-rats. To understand
      the typically complex social behavior of long-lived mammals and protect their
      threatened populations, field studies that cover substantial parts of a species' 
      maximum lifespan are required. However, long-term field studies on mammals are an
      exception because the collection of individualized data requires considerable
      resources over long time periods in species where individuals can live for
      decades. Field studies that span decades do not fit well in the current career
      and funding regime in science. This is unfortunate, as the existing long-term
      studies on mammals yielded exciting insights into animal behavior and contributed
      data important for protecting their populations. Here, I present results of
      long-term field studies on the behavior, demography, and life history of bats,
      with a particular focus on my long-term studies on wild Bechstein's bats. I show 
      that long-term studies on individually marked populations are invaluable to
      understand the social system of bats, investigate the causes and consequences of 
      their extraordinary longevity, and assess their responses to changing
      environments with the aim to efficiently protect these unique mammals in the face
      of anthropogenic global change.

      Properties of SARS-CoV-2 Variant Spike Proteins.
PG  - e37391
LID - 10.2196/37391 [doi]
AB  - Background: A recent global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) created a pandemic and emerged as
      a potential threat to humanity. The analysis of virus genetic composition has
      revealed that the spike protein, one of the major structural proteins,
      facilitates the entry of the virus to host cells. Objective: The spike protein
      has become the main target for prophylactics and therapeutics studies. Here, we
      compared the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants using bioinformatics tools.
      Methods: The spike protein sequences of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its 6
      variants-D614G, alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), delta (B.1.617.2), gamma (P.1), 
      and omicron (B.1.1.529)-were retrieved from the NCBI database. The ClustalX
      program was used to sequence multiple alignment and perform mutational analysis. 
      Several online bioinformatics tools were used to predict the physiological,
      immunological, and structural features of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2
      variants. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using CLC software. Statistical
      analysis of the data was done using jamovi 2 software. Results: Multiple sequence
      analysis revealed that the P681R mutation in the delta variant, which changed an 
      amino acid from histidine (H) to arginine (R), made the protein more alkaline due
      to arginine's high pKa value (12.5) compared to histidine's (6.0).
      Physicochemical properties revealed the relatively higher isoelectric point
      (7.34) and aliphatic index (84.65) of the delta variant compared to other
      variants. Statistical analysis of the isoelectric point, antigenicity, and
      immunogenicity of all the variants revealed significant correlation, with P
      values ranging from <.007 to .04. The generation of a 2D gel map showed the
      separation of the delta spike protein from a grouping of the other variants. The 
      phylogenetic tree of the spike proteins showed that the delta variant was close
      to and a mix of the Rousettus bat coronavirus and MERS-CoV. Conclusions: The
      comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed that the delta variant is
      more aliphatic in nature, which provides more stability to it and subsequently
      influences virus behavior.

TI  - Over-Reporting of Somatic and Psychiatric PTSD Symptoms Among People Who
      Experienced Motor Vehicle Accidents and Did Not Seek Psychiatric Help in a
      Primary Care Setting.
PG  - 1347-1357
LID - 10.2147/PRBM.S340965 [doi]
AB  - Background: Over-reporting of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms has
      been observed in some cases, following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). It has
      been suggested, however, that these are cases of underdiagnoses in primary care
      settings. The current study focused on people with PTSD in primary care settings 
      who experienced an MVA and do not seek psychiatric help. Methods: In the over
      3000 patient registry of a primary care clinic, 174 people who experienced an MVA
      (PE-MVA) were identified. The final sample included 45 PE-MVA, who were
      administered the Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale
      (CAPS-2), and completed the Injury Severity Scale (ISS) and the Minnesota
      Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) content scales. Results: PE-MVA with
      PTSD reported more psychopathology on both MMPI-2 and CAPS-2 than those without
      PTSD. Severity of injury, measured by the ISS, did not differ significantly
      between the two PE-MVA groups. The significant differences between the PE-MVA
      with PTSD and those without PTSD disappeared after adjusting for the covariates
      of bias scales [Infrequency (F) and Fake Bad (FBS)] in MMPI-2, but not in CAPS-2.
      Conclusion: The results suggest that in primary care settings, PE-MVA with PTSD
      who do not seek psychiatric help, over-report psychiatric and somatic symptoms.
      In a personal injury setting the F scale of the MMPI-2 showed less sensitivity to
      exaggerated somatic symptoms than the FBS scale. Bias scales of PE-MVA with PTSD 
      are major contributors to the elevation of the MMPI-2 scores but not the CAPS-2
      score.

AB  - Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a debilitating mast cell-driven disease
      characterized by recurrent wheals and/or angioedema. Substantial progress has
      been made in dissecting the 2 main autoimmune mechanisms that drive the
      pathogenesis of CSU. Type I autoimmune (autoallergic) CSU is associated with IgE 
      antibodies against autoantigens, for example, thyroid peroxidase and IL-24. Type 
      IIb autoimmune CSU is mediated by autoantibodies that activate mast cells, for
      example, via IgE and FcepsilonRI, and is present in less than 10% of patients
      with CSU when strict criteria are used, that is, triple positivity of autologous 
      serum skin test, immunoassays for IgG autoantibodies, and basophil activation
      tests. A subpopulation of patients with CSU has both types. Type IIb autoimmune
      CSU is characterized by higher disease severity, concomitant autoimmune diseases,
      low levels of total IgE, elevated levels of IgG-anti-thyroid peroxidase,
      basopenia, eosinopenia, poor response to antihistamines and to omalizumab, and a 
      good response to cyclosporine. Novel targeted therapies for CSU are under
      development such as ligelizumab, an anti-IgE, fenebrutinib and remibrutinib,
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and dupilumab, an anti-IL-4Ralpha. Further
      studies should investigate the overlap between autoallergic and type IIb
      autoimmune CSU, optimize the diagnosis of both autoimmune endotypes using
      easy-to-perform, noninvasive, and inexpensive markers, and assess differences in 
      response to therapy.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic appeared in China in December 2019 as a cluster of
      transmissible pneumonia caused by a new betacoronavirus. On March 11, 2020, the
      World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. Covid-19 is a mild
      infection in 80% of cases, serious in 15% and critical in 5%. Symptomatic forms
      include a first phase of flu-like viral invasion, and at times a second phase,
      dysimmune and inflammatory, with acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan 
      failure and thromboembolic complications. Degree of severity is related to age
      and comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic Betacoronavirus to
      cross the species barrier. Its genome, an RNA of 29,903 nucleotides, shows strong
      homogeneity with bat coronaviruses from southern China, but the conditions for
      its passage in humans have yet to be elucidated. Mutations can give rise to
      variants of concern (VOC) that are more transmissible and able to evade the
      host's immune response. Several VOCs have succeeded and replaced one another:
      Alpha in October 2020, Beta and Gamma in December 2020, Delta in spring 2021 and 
      Omicron in November 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic has evolved in five waves of
      unequal amplitude and severity, with geographical disparities. Worldwide, it has 
      caused 395,000,000 confirmed cases including 5,700,000 deaths. Epidemiological
      surveillance applies several indicators (incidence rate, test positivity rate,
      effective R and occupancy rate of intensive care beds) supplemented by genomic
      monitoring to detect variants by sequencing. Non-pharmacological measures,
      particularly face mask wearing, have been effective in preventing the
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Few currently available drugs have proven useful,
      with the exception of dexamethazone for patients requiring oxygen therapy.
      Development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines began early on many platforms. Innovation was 
      brought about by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna messenger RNA vaccines, which
      claim protective efficacy of 95% and 94.1% respectively, far higher than the 70% 
      minimum set by the WHO. Governments have hesitated between two strategies,
      mitigation and suppression. The second has been favored in critical periods such 
      as April 2020, when 2.5 billion people throughout the world were confined.
      Vaccination campaigns got underway at the end of December 2020 and progressed
      without reaching sufficient herd immunity, leading some nations to consider
      compulsory vaccination or to require a vaccine or health pass, in order for
      persons to access different activities. Will the pandemic stop with Omicron and
      become endemic? This part of the Covid-19 story remains to be told.

AB  - The use of randomized clinical trials, in particular placebo-controlled trials,
      for drug approval, is the subject of long-standing debate in the scientific
      community and beyond. This study offers consensus recommendations from clinical
      and academic experts to guide the selection of clinical trial design in
      psychiatry. Forty-one highly cited clinical psychiatrists and/or researchers
      participated in a Delphi survey. Consensus statements were developed based on the
      findings of a published, peer-reviewed systematic review. Participants evaluated 
      statements in two survey rounds, following the Delphi method. The expert panel
      achieved consensus on 7 of 21 recommendations regarding the use of randomized
      clinical trials. The endorsed recommendations were: (i) Results from
      placebo-controlled trials are the most reliable and (ii) are necessary despite
      the growing placebo-effect; (iii) it is ethical to enroll patients in
      placebo-arms when established treatment is available, if there is no evidence of 
      increased health risk; (iv) There is a need to approve new drugs with the same
      efficacy as existing treatments, but with different side-effect profiles; (v)
      Non-inferiority trials incur an increased risk of approving ineffective
      medications; (vi) The risk of approving an ineffective drug justifies trial
      designs that incur higher costs, and (vii) superiority trials incur the risk of
      rejecting potentially efficacious treatments. The endorsed recommendations inform
      the choice of trial-design appropriate for approval of psychopharmacological
      drugs. The recommendations strongly support the use of randomized clinical trials
      in general, and the use of placebo-controlled trials in particular.

AB  - Echolocation behavior, a navigation strategy based on acoustic signals, allows
      scientists to explore neural processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. For the
      purpose of orientation, bats broadcast echolocation calls and extract spatial
      information from the echoes. Because bats control call emission and thus the
      availability of spatial information, the behavioral relevance of these signals is
      undiscussable. While most neurophysiological studies, conducted in the past, used
      synthesized acoustic stimuli that mimic portions of the echolocation signals,
      recent progress has been made to understand how naturalistic echolocation signals
      are encoded in the bat brain. Here, we review how does stimulus history affect
      neural processing, how spatial information from multiple objects and how
      echolocation signals embedded in a naturalistic, noisy environment are processed 
      in the bat brain. We end our review by discussing the huge potential that
      state-of-the-art recording techniques provide to gain a more complete picture on 
      the neuroethology of echolocation behavior.

AB  - Muierilor Cave is one of Romania's most important show caves, with
      paleontological and archeological deposits. Recently, a new chamber was
      discovered in the cave, with unique yellow calcite crystals, fine-grained crusts,
      and black sediments. The deposits in this chamber were related to a leaking
      process from the upper level that contains fossil bones and a large pile of
      guano. Samples were taken from the new chamber and another passage to investigate
      the relationship between the substrate and microbial community. Chemical,
      mineralogical, and whole community 16S rRNA gene-based metabarcoding analyses
      were undertaken, and the base of the guano deposit was radiocarbon dated. Our
      study indicated bacteria linked to the presence of high phosphate concentration, 
      most likely due to the nature of the substrate (hydroxyapatite). Bacteria
      involved in Fe, Mn, or N cycles were also found, as these elements are commonly
      identified in high concentrations in guano. Since no bat colonies or fossil bones
      were present in the new chamber, a high concentration of these elements could be 
      sourced by organic deposits inside the cave (guano and fossil bones) even after
      hundreds of years of their deposition and in areas far from both deposits.
      Metabarcoding of the analyzed samples found that approximately 0.7% of the
      identified bacteria are unknown to science, and approximately 47% were not
      previously reported in caves or guano. Moreover, most of the identified
      human-related bacteria were not reported in caves or guano before, and some are
      known for their pathogenic potential. Therefore, continuous monitoring of air and
      floor microbiology should be considered in show caves with organic deposits
      containing bacteria that can threaten human health. The high number of
      unidentified taxa in a small sector of Muierilor Cave indicates the limited
      knowledge of the bacterial diversity in caves that can have potential
      applications in human health and biotechnology.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) is a newly identified virus associated with
      porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) and multisystemic inflammatory
      responses in pigs. Recent studies suggests that PCV3 originated from bat
      circoviruses; however, the origin time, mode of spread, and geographic
      distribution of PCV3 remain unclear. In this study, the evolutionary origin,
      phylodynamics, and phylogeography of PCV3 were reconstructed based on the
      available complete genome sequences. PCV3 showed a closer relationship with bird 
      circovirus than with bat circovirus, but their common ancestor was bat
      circovirus, indicating that birds may be intermediate hosts for the spread of
      circoviruses in pigs. Using the BEAST and phylogenetic analyses, three different 
      clades of PCV3 (PCV3a, PCV3b, and PCV3c) were identified, with PCV3a being the
      most prevalent PCV3 clade. Further studies indicated that the earliest origin of 
      PCV3 can be traced back to 1907.53-1923.44, with a substitution rate of 3.104 x
      10(-4) to 6.8524 x 10(-4) substitution/site/year. A phylogeographic analysis
      highlighted Malaysia as the earliest location of the original PCV3, which
      migrated to Asia, America, and Europe. Overall, this study provides novel
      insights into the evolutionary origin, spread mode, and geographic distribution
      of PCV3, which will facilitate the prevention and control of PCV3 epidemics in
      the future.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a unique tissue, plays a key role in metabolism and
      energy expenditure through adaptive nonshivering thermogenesis. It has recently
      become a therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases.
      The thermogenic effect of BAT occurs through uncoupling protein-1 by uncoupling
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis from energy substrate oxidation. The
      review discusses the recent developments and progress associated with the
      biology, function, and activation of BAT, with a focus on its therapeutic
      potential for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The endocrine
      activity of brown adipocytes affects the energy balance and homeostasis of
      glucose and lipids, thereby affecting the association of BAT activity and the
      metabolic profile. PCOS is a complex reproductive and metabolic disorder of
      reproductive-age women. Functional abnormalities of adipose tissue (AT) have been
      reported in patients with PCOS. Numerous studies have shown that BAT could
      regulate the features of PCOS and that increases in BAT mass or activity were
      effective in the treatment of PCOS through approaches including cold stimulation,
      BAT transplantation and compound activation in various animal models. Therefore, 
      BAT may be used as a novel management strategy for the patients with PCOS to
      improve women's health clinically. It is highly important to identify key brown
      adipokines for the discovery and development of novel candidates to establish an 
      efficacious therapeutic strategy for patients with PCOS in the future.

TI  - Testing Morphological Relationships Between Female and Male Copulatory Structures
      in Bats.
LID - icac040 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/icb/icac040 [doi]
AB  - The lower reproductive tract of female mammals has several competing functions
      including mating, tract health maintenance, and parturition. Diverse vaginal
      anatomy suggests interactions between natural and sexual selection, yet despite
      its importance, female copulatory morphology remains under-studied. We undertook 
      a comparative study across the species-rich mammalian order Chiroptera (bats)
      with a focus on the suborder Yangochiroptera (Vespertilioniformes) to examine how
      female vaginal features may have coevolved with male penis morphology to minimize
      mechanical damage to their tissues during copulation. The penis morphology is
      diverse, presenting great potential for post-copulatory sexual selection and
      coevolution with the female morphology, but vaginas have not been carefully
      examined. Here we test the hypotheses that vaginal thickness and collagen density
      have coevolved with features of the male penis including the presence of spines
      and a baculum. We present histological data from females of 24 species from 7
      families of bats, and corresponding data on male penis anatomy. We also examine
      the role of phylogenetic history in the morphological patterns we observe. We
      found evidence that female vaginal thickness has coevolved with the presence of
      penile spines, but not with baculum presence or width. Collagen density did not
      appear to covary with male penile features. Our findings highlight the importance
      of considering interactions between the sexes in influencing functional
      reproductive structures and examine how these structures have been under
      selection in bats.

TI  - Comparing the histological assessment following ridge preservation using a
      composite bovine-derived xenograft versus an alloplast hydroxyapatite-sugar
      cross-linked collagen matrix.
LID - 10.1002/JPER.22-0149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the
      histological wound healing and alveolar ridge dimensional changes following ridge
      preservation using two different xenograft/collagen matrices. METHODS: Fifty-four
      patients each with non-molar teeth that required extraction and replacement with 
      dental implants were enrolled. Teeth extractions were completed with minimal flap
      reflection and were randomized to receive ridge preservation with either 90%
      bovine-derived xenograft granules in a 10% porcine collagen matrix (Group A) or a
      sponge-like matrix of 80% microparticulate hydroxyapatite alloplast graft with
      20% sugar cross-linked porcine type 1 collagen (Group B). After 16 weeks of
      healing and at the time of implant placement, a bone core biopsy was harvested
      followed by dental implant placement. The primary histological outcome evaluated 
      were percentage of vital bone formation and connective tissue/other (fibrous
      tissue and marrow space). Secondary outcomes included the change in alveolar
      ridge width and the buccal and lingual ridge height. Statistical analysis was
      completed with two-sample t-test and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Forty-four
      patients completed the study, 23 in group A and 21 in group B. Group B presented 
      with statistically significantly (p = 0.02) more percentage of vital bone (39.3
      +/- 17.8) than group A (26.8 +/- 15.8). No statistically significant difference
      was observed for changes in alveolar ridge dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: Group B, when
      used for ridge preservation, yields statistically significantly more vital bone

AB  - Coronavirus is one of the RNA viruses with the largest genome; It is a group of
      viruses known to infect humans very little until the end of the 20th century,
      generally causing infection in animals (bird, cat, pig, mouse, horse, bat). It is
      the causative agent of 15-30% of seasonal lower and upper respiratory tract
      infections, and may rarely cause gastrointestinal and nervous system infections. 
      We have obtained results for the collagenase and elastase enzymes were at the
      micromolar level. We obtained IC50 results for the collagenase enzyme for
      6-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin 257.22 +/- 34.07 microM and for
      2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone 74.46 +/- 8.61 microM. 6-Hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin and
      2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone were considered good inhibitors for elastase enzyme.
      Additionally, these compounds significantly decreased human pancreatic cancer
      cell viability from low doses. In addition, 100 microM dose of all compounds
      caused significant reductions in human pancreatic cancer cell viability. IC50
      results (IC50: 10-50 microM) were better than control. In the otherwords, the
      docking results suggest that both compounds tend to have lower efficacy on the
      main protease targets of SARS-CoV-2 than standard compounds, (NL-1 and NL-2). The
      reason for this is that the standard compounds interact strongly and more
      frequently with the target proteins, and the surface areas they cover on the
      active surface are much larger than the small ligand molecules studied.

PG  - 202-212
LID - 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000827 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the high prevalence of shellfish allergy, the clinical
      management of seafood allergy has remained unchanged over decades. Here, we
      examined the current status in the diagnosis and clinical management of shellfish
      allergy and highlighted the imminent need for more specific diagnostic methods,
      as well as effective and safe therapeutic approaches for shellfish allergy.
      RECENT FINDINGS: With the advancement in the molecular identifications and
      definition of reactive epitopes of shellfish allergens, new diagnostic designs
      such as component-resolved diagnosis, basophil activation test (BAT) and the
      emerging IgE-crosslinking-induced luciferase expression are emerging.
      Furthermore, various allergen-specific immunotherapy strategies (such as
      shellfish extracts and allergens, hypoallergens, hypoallergen DNA vaccines,
      mimotopes and peptide-based therapies) are being explored at preclinical stages
      whereas limited nonallergen specific immunotherapy approaches are under clinical 
      trials. SUMMARY: With an increasing understanding of the underlying immunological
      mechanisms and molecular features of shellfish allergy, the future for developing
      precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to better manage shellfish allergy 
      is promising.

PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000826 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Tree nut (TN) and seed allergies are frequent, and their
      prevalence appears to be on the rise. Allergic reactions associated with these
      foods are more frequently severe, and these allergies tend to persist into
      adulthood, consequently affecting quality of life. In this review, we summarize
      recent advances in diagnostic modalities and management strategies for
      TN/seed-allergic patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical manifestations of TN and
      seed allergy range from asymptomatic sensitization to severe anaphylactic
      reactions. The use of emerging diagnostic tools such as component resolved
      diagnostics (CRD) and the basophil activation test (BAT) can help better predict 
      clinical reactivity, the latter being currently reserved for research settings.
      Strict avoidance of all TN is generally not required, as most patients can
      tolerate select TN despite co-sensitization. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a
      promising alternative treatment instead of complete avoidance of culprit
      allergens, as it can safely increase the allergy threshold. SUMMARY: Our recent
      understanding of co-reactivity between various TN and seeds has shaped management
      opportunities, including select TN introduction and optimization of OIT, two
      strategies which may improve quality of life. There is a need for better
      minimally invasive diagnostic methods for TN and seed allergy, with CRD and BAT
      being promising tools.

      attenuating afferent innervation.
PG  - 195-207
LID - 10.7555/JBR.36.20220033 [doi]
AB  - Orexin signaling has been associated with energy expenditure and brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) function. However, conflicting data exist in the field about how
      orexin signaling regulates BAT thermogenesis. In this study, we show that a
      specific orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R) agonist [Ala11, D-Leu15]-OxB (OB-Ala)
      inhibited intrascapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) thermogenesis by reducing
      sympathetic output to iBAT. This effect is mediated by OX2Rs located on afferent 
      nerve endings innervating iBAT instead of brown adipocyte itself. Microinjection 
      of OB-Ala into iBAT inhibited iBAT thermogenesis in mice upon cold exposure and
      neuronal activity in the paraventricular nucleus. Findings suggest that OB-Ala
      could inhibit iBAT thermogenesis by attenuating sensory input thereby inhibiting 
      the sympathetic-sensory iBAT feedback loop. Our study uncovers a novel primary
      action site of orexin in the regulation of energy balance.

TI  - Knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes by residents in Punjab and Khyber
      Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan in connection with bats.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/s13002-022-00541-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit bats play an important role in pollination and seed dispersal, 
      and their conservation is important to maintain the productivity of some crops
      and natural ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the
      knowledge, attitudes, and perception of fruit bats by orchard farmers and
      agricultural communities in Pakistan. METHODS: The present survey was conducted
      in two districts (i.e. Sheikhupura and Malakand districts) within Punjab and
      Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces based on the higher number of fruit growing areas
      and bat roosting sites. A total of 200 (100 per district) close-ended
      questionnaires with 53 questions were administered to randomly selected
      respondents within the selected communities associated with fruit orchards,
      including orchard owners, laborers, and members of the surrounding community.
      Each questionnaire was divided into seven sections (i.e., demographic
      information, environmental and public health effects of bats, knowledge about
      bats, perception and control of bats, non-lethal methods adopted to control bats,
      and different myths about bats). RESULTS: A majority of respondents (59%, n =
      118) mis-classified bats as birds instead of mammals despite more than 84%
      reporting that they have observed bats. Nearly 71.5% of orchard farmers perceived
      that their fruits are contaminated by bats during consumption, and a majority
      believe that bats destroy orchards (62.5%) and are responsible for spreading
      disease. Mythology about bats was ambiguous, as 49% of those surveyed did not
      perceived bats to bring good luck (49%), and 50% did not perceived them to be bad
      omens either. Most respondents have never killed a bat (68%) nor would they kill 
      a bat if given the opportunity (95%). Regarding the control of bats, the greatest
      percentage of respondents strongly disagree with shooting bats (36%) and strongly
      agree with leaving bats alone (42.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a better 
      understanding of the sociodemographic factors associated with knowledge, attitude
      and perception of bats from fruit orchard owners, labourers and local people. We 
      recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community,
      highlighting the ecosystem services and importance of bat conservation to improve
      people's current knowledge regarding the role of bats and reduce direct
      persecution against bats.

      mutations from the genome of SARS-CoV. At least 35 indel sites were confirmed in 
      the genome of SARS-CoV-2, in which 17 were with >/=10 consecutive bases long. Ten
      of these relatively long indels were located in the spike (S) gene, five in
      nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3) gene of open reading frame (ORF) 1a, and one in
      ORF8 and noncoding region. Seventeen (48.6%) of the 35 indels were based on
      insertion-and-deletion mutations with exchanged gene sequences of 7-325
      consecutive bases. Almost the complete ORF8 gene was replaced by a single 325
      consecutive base-long indel. The distribution of these indels was roughly in
      accordance with the distribution of the rate of point mutation rate around the
      indels. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was 96.0% identical to that of RaTG13. 
      There was no long insertion-and-deletion mutation between the genomes of RaTG13
      and SARS-CoV-2. The findings of the uneven distribution of multiple indels and
      the presence of multiple long insertion-and-deletion mutations with exchanged
      consecutive base sequences in the viral genome may provide insights into
      SARS-CoV-2 development. IMPORTANCE The developmental mechanism of severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains inconclusive. This study 
      compared the base sequence one-by-one between severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or bat coronavirus RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2. The genomes of
      SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were 77.9% and 77.7% identical to the genome of SARS-CoV,
      respectively. Seventeen of the 35 sites with insertion and/or deletion mutations 
      between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were based on insertion-and-deletion mutations
      with the replacement of 7-325 consecutive bases. Most of these long
      insertion-and-deletion sites were concentrated in the nonstructural protein 3
      (Nsp3) gene of open reading frame (ORF) 1a, S1 domain of the spike protein, and
      ORF8 genes. Such long insertion-and-deletion mutations were not observed between 
      the genomes of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2. The presence of multiple long
      insertion-and-deletion mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and their uneven
      distributions may provide further insights into the development of the virus.

TI  - Androgen signaling in adipose tissue, but less likely skeletal muscle, mediates
      development of metabolic traits in a PCOS mouse model.
PG  - E145-E158
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00418.2021 [doi]
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, multifactorial disorder
      characterized by endocrine, reproductive, and metabolic dysfunction. As the
      etiology of PCOS is unknown, there is no cure and symptom-oriented treatments are
      suboptimal. Hyperandrogenism is a key diagnostic trait, and evidence suggests
      that androgen receptor (AR)-mediated actions are critical to PCOS pathogenesis.
      However, the key AR target sites involved remain to be fully defined. Adipocyte
      and muscle dysfunction are proposed as important sites involved in the
      manifestation of PCOS traits. We investigated the role of AR signaling in white
      adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle in the
      development of PCOS in a hyperandrogenic PCOS mouse model. As expected,
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT) exposure induced key reproductive and metabolic PCOS
      traits in wild-type (WT) females. Transplantation of AR-insensitive (AR(-/-)) WAT
      or BAT from AR knockout females (ARKO) into DHT-treated WT mice ameliorated some 
      metabolic PCOS features, including increased body weight, adiposity, and
      adipocyte hypertrophy, but not reproductive PCOS traits. In contrast, DHT-treated
      ARKO female mice transplanted with AR-responsive (AR(+/+)) WAT or BAT continued
      to resist developing PCOS traits. DHT-treated skeletal muscle-specific AR
      knockout females (SkMARKO) displayed a comparable phenotype with that of
      DHT-treated WT females, with full development of PCOS traits. Taken together,
      these findings infer that both WAT and BAT, but less likely skeletal muscle, are 
      key sites of AR-mediated actions involved in the experimental pathogenesis of
      metabolic PCOS traits. These data further support targeting adipocyte AR-driven
      pathways in future research aimed at developing novel therapeutic interventions
      for PCOS.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Hyperandrogenism is a key feature in the pathogenesis
      of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); however, the tissue sites of androgen
      receptor (AR) signaling are unclear. In this study, AR signaling in white and
      brown adipose tissue, but less likely in skeletal muscle, was found to be
      involved in the development of metabolic PCOS traits, highlighting the importance
      of androgen actions in adipose tissue and obesity in the manifestation of
      metabolic disturbances.

TI  - Informing wind energy development: Land cover and topography predict occupancy
      for Arizona bats.
PG  - e0268573
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268573 [doi]
AB  - Wind energy is a growing source of renewable energy with a 3-fold increase in use
      globally over the last decade. However, wind turbines cause bat mortality,
      especially for migratory species. The southwest United States has high bat
      species diversity and is an important area for migratory species, although little
      is known about their seasonal distribution. To examine potential risk to bats in 
      areas proposed for wind energy development, we characterized bat occupancy
      spatially and temporally across northern Arizona, identifying use during summer
      when bats are reproductively active and fall during the migratory season. Our
      objectives were to determine occupancy of migratory species and species of
      greatest conservation need and develop a probability of occupancy map for species
      to identify areas of potential conflict with wind energy development. We selected
      92 sites in 10 clusters with potential for development and used acoustic
      detectors to sample bats in the summer and fall of 2016 and 2017 for 6 nights per
      site per year. We predicted response of migratory bat species and species of
      special concern to 9 landscape variables using Program MARK. During summer,
      higher densities of forest on the landscape resulted in a higher probability of
      occupancy of migratory species such as hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus),
      silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), big free-tailed bats (Nyctinomops
      macrotis), and species of conservation need such as spotted bats (Euderma
      maculatum). During the fall, higher concentration of valleys on the landscape
      predicted occupancy of hoary bats, big free-tailed bats, and spotted bats. High
      bat occupancy in the fall was also associated with higher elevation and close
      proximity to forests. We recommend that wind turbines be placed in open, flat
      grasslands away from forested landscapes and concentrations of valleys or other
      topographic variation.

TI  - Mapping Risk of Nipah Virus Transmission from Bats to Humans in Thailand.
PG  - 175-189
LID - 10.1007/s10393-022-01588-6 [doi]
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that can pose a serious threat to human and
      livestock health. Old-world fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir 
      hosts for NiV, and Pteropus lylei, Lyle's flying fox, is an important host of NiV
      in mainland Southeast Asia. NiV can be transmitted from bats to humans directly
      via bat-contaminated foods (i.e., date palm sap or fruit) or indirectly via
      livestock or other intermediate animal hosts. Here we construct risk maps for NiV
      spillover and transmission by combining ecological niche models for the P. lylei 
      bat reservoir with other spatial data related to direct or indirect NiV
      transmission (livestock density, foodborne sources including fruit production,
      and human population). We predict the current and future (2050 and 2070)
      distribution of P. lylei across Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Our best-fit
      model predicted that central and western regions of Thailand and small areas in
      Cambodia are currently the most suitable habitats for P. lylei. However, due to
      climate change, the species range is predicted to expand to include lower
      northern, northeastern, eastern, and upper southern Thailand and almost all of
      Cambodia and lower southern Vietnam. This expansion will create additional risk
      areas for human infection from P. lylei in Thailand. Our combined predictive risk
      maps showed that central Thailand, inhabited by 2.3 million people, is considered
      highly suitable for the zoonotic transmission of NiV from P. lylei. These current
      and future NiV transmission risk maps can be used to prioritize sites for active 
      virus surveillance and developing awareness and prevention programs to reduce the
      risk of NiV spillover and spread in Thailand.

      intra-articular injection of a high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid
      formulation (HA-HL) was shown to be effective in providing a clinically
      meaningful reduction in pain and functional limitation up to 24 weeks in subjects
      with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this post hoc analyses is
      to assess the cost-effectiveness of HA-HL compared with placebo using individual 
      patient data from this clinical trial in a Swiss health care perspective.
      METHODS: A total of 692 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomly 
      allocated to HA-HL or placebo groups. Each patient received one intra-articular
      injection of HA-HL or placebo at baseline and was then followed-up for a total
      duration of 24 weeks with five follow-up visits (i.e., after weeks 1, 6, 12, 18, 
      and 24). The EQ-5D-5L five-point verbal Likert scale was used to calculate the
      health utility and the related quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using the
      area-under-the-curve (AUC) method. For the costs, the price of HA-HL in
      Switzerland was used. The primary threshold for the incremental
      cost/effectiveness ratio (ICER) below which HA-HL was considered as
      cost-effective was 91,540 Swiss francs (CHF) per QALY (i.e., US $100,000).
      RESULTS: No significant difference between the baseline characteristics of the
      HA-HL group and the placebo group was observed. With a mean ICER of 27,212 CHF
      per QALY (95% CI 20,135-34,289), HA-HL was considered as cost-effective compared 
      to placebo. Sensitivity analyses (e.g., using lower or upper limit prices or
      using other threshold values) gave similar results, i.e., ICERs far below the
      threshold values of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the
      role of HA-HL as a cost-effective therapeutic option in the management of OA.
      However, more studies taking into account the utilization of other health care
      resources are needed.

AB  - Increasing levels of artificial light at night (ALAN) are a major threat to
      global biodiversity and can have negative impacts on a wide variety of organisms 
      and their ecosystems. Nocturnal species such as bats are highly vulnerable to the
      detrimental effects of ALAN. A variety of lighting management strategies have
      been adopted to minimise the impacts of ALAN on wildlife, however relatively
      little is known about their effectiveness. Using an experimental approach, we
      provide the first evidence of negative impacts of part-night lighting (PNL)
      strategies on bats. Feeding activity of Myotis spp. was reduced along rivers
      exposed to PNL despite no reduction in overall bat activity. We also provide the 
      first evidence of negative effects of PNL on both feeding and activity for
      Pipistrellus pipistrellus which has previously been recorded feeding under
      artificial light. Despite having considerable energy-saving benefits, we outline 
      the potential negative impacts of PNL schemes for bats in riparian habitats. PNL 
      are unlikely to provide desired conservation outcomes for bats, and can
      potentially fragment important foraging habitats leading to a breakdown of
      functional connectivity across the landscape. We highlight the potential
      dichotomy for strategies which attempt to simultaneously address climate change
      and biodiversity loss and recommend alternative management strategies to limit
      the impacts of ALAN on biodiversity.

TI  - The nonstructural p17 protein of a fusogenic bat-borne reovirus regulates viral
      replication in virus species- and host-specific manners.
PG  - e1010553
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010553 [doi]
AB  - Nelson Bay orthoreovirus (NBV), a member of the family Reoviridae, genus
      Orthoreovirus, is a bat-borne virus that causes respiratory diseases in humans.
      NBV encodes two unique nonstructural proteins, fusion-associated small
      transmembrane (FAST) protein and p17 protein, in the S1 gene segment. FAST
      induces cell-cell fusion between infected cells and neighboring cells and the
      fusogenic activity is required for efficient viral replication. However, the
      function of p17 in the virus cycle is not fully understood. Here, various p17
      mutant viruses including p17-deficient viruses were generated by a reverse
      genetics system for NBV. The results demonstrated that p17 is not essential for
      viral replication and does not play an important role in viral pathogenesis. On
      the other hand, NBV p17 regulated viral replication in a bat cell line but not in
      other human and animal cell lines. Nuclear localization of p17 is associated with
      the regulation of NBV replication in bat cells. We also found that p17
      dramatically enhances the cell-cell fusion activity of NBV FAST protein for
      efficient replication in bat cells. Furthermore, we found that a protein
      homologue of NBV p17 from another bat-borne orthoreovirus, but not those of avian
      orthoreovirus or baboon orthoreovirus, also supported efficient viral replication
      in bat cells using a p17-deficient virus-based complementation approach. These
      results provide critical insights into the functioning of the unique replication 
      machinery of bat-borne viruses in their natural hosts.

TI  - Brown Adipocyte ADRB3 Mediates Cardioprotection via Suppressing Exosomal iNOS.
PG  - 133-147
LID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.320470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADRB3 (beta3-adrenergic receptors), which is predominantly
      expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), can activate BAT and improve metabolic
      health. Previous studies indicate that the endocrine function of BAT is
      associated with cardiac homeostasis and diseases. Here, we investigate the role
      of ADRB3 activation-mediated BAT function in cardiac remodeling. METHODS: BKO
      (brown adipocyte-specific ADRB3 knockout) and littermate control mice were
      subjected to Ang II (angiotensin II) for 28 days. Exosomes from ADRB3 antagonist 
      SR59230A (SR-exo) or agonist mirabegron (MR-exo) treated brown adipocytes were
      intravenously injected to Ang II-infused mice. RESULTS: BKO markedly accelerated 
      cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis compared with control mice after Ang II
      infusion. In vitro, ADRB3 KO rather than control brown adipocytes aggravated
      expression of fibrotic genes in cardiac fibroblasts, and this difference was not 
      detected after exosome inhibitor treatment. Consistently, BKO brown
      adipocyte-derived exosomes accelerated Ang II-induced cardiac fibroblast
      dysfunction compared with control exosomes. Furthermore, SR-exo significantly
      aggravated Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling, whereas MR-exo attenuated cardiac
      dysfunction. Mechanistically, ADRB3 KO or SR59230A treatment in brown adipocytes 
      resulted an increase of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) in exosomes.
      Knockdown of iNOS in brown adipocytes reversed SR-exo-aggravated cardiac
      remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrated a new endocrine pattern of BAT in
      regulating cardiac remodeling, suggesting that activation of ADRB3 in brown
      adipocytes offers cardiac protection through suppressing exosomal iNOS.

AB  - Early childhood malnutrition may facilitate the onset of obesity and diabetes
      mellitus in adulthood which, when established, makes it more resistant to
      therapeutic interventions. The beneficial effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid
      (TUDCA) in glucose homeostasis and body fat accumulation were analyzed in
      protein-restricted mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6 mice were fed a
      control (14% protein [C]) or a protein-restricted (6% protein [R]) diet for 6
      weeks. Afterward, mice received an HFD or not for 12 weeks (C mice fed an HFD
      [CH] and R mice fed an HFD [RH]). In the last 15 days of this period, half of the
      mice fed a HFD received i.p. PBS (groups CH and RH) or 300 mg/kg TUDCA (groups
      CHT and RHT). RH mice developed obesity, as demonstrated by the increase in fat
      accumulation, liver steatosis, and metabolic inflexibility. Additionally, showed 
      glucose intolerance and insulin hypersecretion. TUDCA reduced adiposity and
      improve metabolic flexibility through increased HSL phosphorylation and CPT1
      expression in eWAT and BAT, and reduced ectopic fat deposition by activating the 
      AMPK/HSL pathway in the liver. Also, improved glucose tolerance and insulin
      sensitivity, normalizing insulin secretion by reducing GDH expression and
      increasing insulin peripheral sensitivity by greater expression of the IRbeta in 
      muscle and adipose tissue and reducing PEPCK liver expression. Our data indicate 
      that TUDCA reduces global adiposity and improves glucose tolerance and insulin
      sensitivity in protein malnourished mice fed a HFD. Therefore, this is a possible
      strategy to reverse metabolic disorders in individuals with the double burden of 
      malnutrition.

TI  - Silk Hydrogel-Mediated Delivery of Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7 Directly to
      Subcutaneous White Adipose Tissue Increases Browning and Energy Expenditure.
PG  - 884601
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.884601 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Increasing the mass and/or activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is
      one promising avenue for treating obesity and related metabolic conditions, given
      that BAT has a high potential for energy expenditure and is capable of improving 
      glucose and lipid homeostasis. BAT occurs either in discrete "classical" depots, 
      or interspersed in white adipose tissue (WAT), termed "inducible/recruitable"
      BAT, or 'beige/brite' adipocytes. We and others have demonstrated that bone
      morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) induces brown adipogenesis in committed and
      uncommitted progenitor cells, resulting in increased energy expenditure and
      reduced weight gain in mice. BMP7 is therefore a reliable growth factor to induce
      browning of WAT. Methods: In this study, we sought to deliver BMP7 specifically
      to subcutaneous (sc)WAT in order to induce tissue-resident progenitor cells to
      differentiate into energy-expending recruitable brown adipocytes, without
      off-target effects like bone formation, which can occur when BMPs are in the
      presence of bone progenitor cells (outside of WAT). BMP7 delivery directly to WAT
      may also promote tissue innervation, or directly activate mitochondrial activity 
      in brown adipocytes, as we have demonstrated previously. We utilized silk protein
      in the form of an injectable hydrogel carrying BMP7. Silk scaffolds are useful
      for in vivo delivery of substances due to favorable material properties,
      including controlled release of therapeutic proteins in an active form,
      biocompatibility with minimal immunogenic response, and prior FDA approval for
      some medical materials. For this study, the silk was engineered to meet desirable
      release kinetics for BMP7 in order to mimic our prior in vitro brown adipocyte
      differentiation studies. Fluorescently-labeled silk hydrogel loaded with BMP7 was
      directly injected into WAT through the skin and monitored by non-invasive in vivo
      whole body imaging, including in UCP1-luciferase reporter mice, thereby enabling 
      an approach that is translatable to humans. Results: Injection of the BMP7-loaded
      silk hydrogels into the subcutaneous WAT of mice resulted in "browning",
      including the development of multilocular, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive
      brown adipocytes, and an increase in whole-body energy expenditure and skin
      temperature. In diet-induced obese mice, BMP7-loaded silk delivery to
      subcutaneous WAT resulted in less weight gain, reduced circulating glucose and
      lower respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Conclusions: In summary, BMP7 delivery
      via silk scaffolds directly into scWAT is a novel translational approach to
      increase browning and energy expenditure, and represents a potential therapeutic 
      avenue for delivering substances directly to adipose depots in pursuit of
      metabolic treatments.

TI  - Description of Staphylococcal Strains from Straw-Coloured Fruit Bat (Eidolon

      Phylogenetic Relationships to Other Staphylococci.
PG  - 878137
LID - 10.3389/fcimb.2022.878137 [doi]
AB  - The phylogenetic tree of the Staphylococcus aureus complex consists of several
      distinct clades and the majority of human and veterinary S. aureus isolates form 
      one large clade. In addition, two divergent clades have recently been described
      as separate species. One was named Staphylococcus argenteus, due to the lack of
      the "golden" pigment staphyloxanthin. The second one is S. schweitzeri, found in 
      humans and animals from Central and West Africa. In late 2021, two additional
      species, S. roterodami and S. singaporensis, have been described from clinical
      samples from Southeast Asia. In the present study, isolates and their genome
      sequences from wild Straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and a Diamond
      firetail (Stagonopleura guttata, an estrildid finch) kept in a German aviary are 
      described. The isolates possessed staphyloxanthin genes and were closer related
      to S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri than to S. aureus. Phylogenetic analysis
      revealed that they were nearly identical to both, S. roterodami and S.
      singaporensis. We propose considering the study isolates, the recently described 
      S. roterodami and S. singaporensis as well as some Chinese strains with MLST
      profiles stored in the PubMLST database as different clonal complexes within one 
      new species. According to the principle of priority we propose it should be named
      S. roterodami. This species is more widespread than previously believed, being
      observed in West Africa, Southeast Asia and Southern China. It has a zoonotic
      connection to bats and has been shown to be capable of causing skin and soft
      tissue infections in humans. It is positive for staphyloxanthin, and it could be 
      mis-identified as S. aureus (or S. argenteus) using routine procedures. However, 
      it can be identified based on distinct MLST alleles, and "S. aureus" sequence
      types ST2470, ST3135, ST3952, ST3960, ST3961, ST3963, ST3965, ST3980, ST4014,
      ST4075, ST4076, ST4185, ST4326, ST4569, ST6105, ST6106, ST6107, ST6108, ST6109,
      ST6999 and ST7342 belong to this species.

LID - 32 [pii]

AB  - Cold and nutrient-activated brown adipose tissue (BAT) is capable of increasing
      systemic energy expenditure via the uncoupled respiration and secretion of
      endocrine factors, thereby protecting mice against diet-induced obesity and
      improving insulin response and glucose tolerance in men. Long non-coding RNAs
      (lncRNAs) have recently been identified as fine-tuning regulators of cellular
      function. While certain lncRNAs have been functionally characterised in adipose
      tissue, their overall contribution in the activation of BAT remains elusive. We
      identified lncRNAs correlating to interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT)
      function in a high fat diet (HFD) and cold stressed mice. We focused on Gm15551, 
      which has an adipose tissue specific expression profile, is highly upregulated
      during adipogenesis, and downregulated by beta-adrenergic activation in mature
      adipocytes. Although we performed comprehensive transcriptional and adipocyte
      physiology profiling in vitro and in vivo, we could not detect an effect of gain 
      or loss of function of Gm15551.

TI  - Endothelial Cells Induced Progenitors Into Brown Fat to Reduce Atherosclerosis.
PG  - 168-183
LID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319582 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) can increase atherosclerotic and
      cardiovascular risk by inducing endothelial dysfunction, decreasing nitric oxide 
      (NO) production, and accelerating arterial inflammation. The aim is to determine 
      the mechanism by which insulin action and NO production in endothelial cells can 
      improve systemic bioenergetics and decrease atherosclerosis via differentiation
      of perivascular progenitor cells (PPCs) into brown adipocytes (BAT). METHODS:
      Studies used various endothelial transgenic and deletion mutant ApoE(-/-) mice of
      insulin receptors, eNOS (endothelial NO synthase) and ETBR (endothelin receptor
      type B) receptors for assessments of atherosclerosis. Cells were isolated from
      perivascular fat and micro-vessels for studies on differentiation and signaling
      mechanisms in responses to NO, insulin, and lipokines from BAT. RESULTS:
      Enhancing insulin's actions on endothelial cells and NO production in ECIRS1
      transgenic mice reduced body weight and increased systemic energy expenditure and
      BAT mass and activity by inducing differentiation of PPCs into beige/BAT even
      with high-fat diet. However, positive changes in bioenergetics, BAT
      differentiation from PPCs and weight loss were inhibited by
      N(gamma)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of eNOS, in ECIRS1 
      mice and eNOSKO mice. The mechanism mediating NO's action on PPC differentiation 
      into BAT was identified as the activation of solubilized guanylate
      cyclase/PKGIalpha (cGMP protein-dependent kinase Ialpha)/GSK3beta (glycogen
      synthase kinase 3beta) pathways. Plasma lipidomics from ECIRS1 mice with
      NO-induced increased BAT mass revealed elevated 12,13-diHOME production. Infusion
      of 12,13-diHOME improved endothelial dysfunction and decreased atherosclerosis,
      whereas its reduction had opposite effects in ApoE(-)(/-)mice. CONCLUSIONS:
      Activation of eNOS and endothelial cells by insulin enhanced the differentiation 
      of PPC to BAT and its lipokines and improved systemic bioenergetics and
      atherosclerosis, suggesting that endothelial dysfunction is a major contributor
      of energy disequilibrium in obesity.

TI  - Brown adipose tissue - a translational perspective.
LID - bnac015 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/endrev/bnac015 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) displays the unique capacity to generate heat through 
      uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation that makes it a very attractive therapeutic
      target for cardiometabolic diseases. Here, we review BAT cellular metabolism, its
      regulation by the central nervous and endocrine systems and circulating
      metabolites, the plausible roles of this tissue in human thermoregulation, energy
      balance and cardiometabolic disorders, and the current knowledge on its
      pharmacological stimulation in humans. The current definition and measurement of 
      BAT in human studies relies almost exclusively on BAT glucose uptake from
      positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxiglucose ( 18FDG), which
      can be dissociated from BAT thermogenic activity, as for example in insulin
      resistant states. The most important energy substrate for BAT thermogenesis is
      its intracellular fatty acid content mobilized from sympathetic stimulation of
      intracellular triglyceride (TG) lipolysis. This lipolytic BAT response is
      intertwined with that of white adipose and other metabolic tissues, and cannot be
      independently stimulated with the drugs tested thus far. BAT is an interesting
      and biologically plausible target that has yet to be fully and selectively
      activated to increase the body's thermogenic response and shift energy balance.
      The field of human BAT research is in need of methods able to directly,
      specifically and reliably measure BAT thermogenic capacity while also tracking
      the related thermogenic responses in white adipose and other tissues. Until this 
      is achieved, uncertainty will remain about the role played by this fascinating
      tissue in human cardiometabolic diseases.

TI  - The effects of graded levels of calorie restriction XVIII: tissue specific
      changes in cell size and number in response to calorie restriction.
LID - glac110 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glac110 [doi]
AB  - Calorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition increases the health- and lifespan 
      of diverse taxa. The mechanism(s) behind CR are debated but may be directly
      linked to body composition changes that maintain energy balance. During a
      deficit, energy is primarily obtained from white adipose tissue (WAT; utilized)
      whilst other tissues remain unchanged (protected) or grow (invested) relative to 
      body mass. The changes in mass of 6 tissues from 48 male C57BL/6 mice following
      3-months graded (10, 20, 30, or 40%) CR or fed ad libitum for 12 or 24hr a day
      were related to cell size (hypo/hypertrophy) and/or number (hypo/hyperplasia).
      Tissues studied were: retroperitoneal and subcutaneous WAT, brown adipose tissue 
      (BAT) (utilized); lungs (protected), and stomach and caecum (invested).
      Methodology was based on number of nuclei/ tissue equalling the number of cells. 
      Extracted DNA was quantified and used to estimate cell numbers (Total DNA/DNA per
      diploid nucleus) and size (Tissue mass/nuclei number). WAT utilization was caused
      solely by hypotrophy whereas BAT utilization resulted from reduced cell number
      and size. WAT cell size positively correlated with circulating hormones related
      to energy balance and BAT cell number and size positively correlated with body
      temperature. No changes were found in the lungs, consistent with their protected 
      status, whereas hyperplasia appeared to be the dominant mechanism for invested
      alimentary-tract tissues. These findings indicate the pattern of change of cell
      size and number across increasing levels of short-term CR is tissue-specific.

TI  - Traveler Mites: Population Genetic Structure of the Wing Mites Periglischrus
      paracaligus (Acari: Mesostigmata: Spinturnicidae).
PG  - 1198-1210
LID - 10.1093/jme/tjac059 [doi]
AB  - Wing mites of the genus Periglischrus are ectoparasites exclusively associated
      with phyllostomid bats. These mites show high host specificity and have been
      studied to understand the evolutionary history of their bat hosts mainly by using
      a morphological variation. Through a phylogeographic approach, we analyzed the
      genetic diversity and population genetic structure of the ectoparasite
      Periglischrus paracaligus Herrin and Tipton which parasitizes Leptonycteris
      yerbabuenae Martinez and Villa (lesser long-nosed bat) in Mexico. By the
      implementation of a multilocus approach, we found that P. paracaligus populations
      were diverse for haplotype diversity, and had values ranging from 0.5 to 1. No
      genetic structuring in the P. paracaligus parasites was observed along with the
      distribution of the host, L. yerbabuenae, in Mexico, nor when populations or
      regions were compared, but our results revealed a process of historical
      demographic expansion in all the analyzed markers. We discuss possible scenarios 
      that could explain the lack of population structure in the light of the data
      analyzed for the parasites and the biology of L. yerbabuenae, such as the
      interplay between parasite and host traits being responsible for the genetic
      make-up of parasite populations. We also inferred its phylogenetic position among
      wing mites parasitizing the two other species of Leptonycteris bats. Long-nosed
      bats' monophyly helps to explain the observed presence of distinctive clades in
      the wing mite's phylogeny in specific association with each long-nosed bat host
      species.

TI  - A Look inside the Replication Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Blyth's Horseshoe Bat
      (Rhinolophus lepidus) Kidney Cells.
PG  - e0044922
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00449-22 [doi]
AB  - Bats are considered the natural reservoir of numerous emerging viruses such as
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs). There is a need for 
      immortalized bat cell lines to culture and investigate the pathogenicity,
      replication kinetics, and evolution of emerging coronaviruses. We illustrate the 
      susceptibility and permissiveness of a spontaneously immortalized kidney cell
      line (Rhileki) from Blyth's horseshoe bat (R. lepidus) to SARS-CoV-2 virus,
      including clinical isolates, suggesting a possible virus-host relationship. We
      were able to observe limited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhileki cells compared
      with simian VeroE6 cells. Slower viral replication in Rhileki cells was indicated
      by higher ct values (RT-PCR) at later time points of the viral culture and
      smaller foci (foci forming assay) compared with those of VeroE6 cells. With this 
      study we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not restricted to R. sinicus 
      and could include more Rhinolophus species. The establishment of a continuous
      Rhinolophus lepidus kidney cell line allows further characterization of
      SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhinolophus bat cells, as well as isolation attempts of
      other bat-borne viruses. IMPORTANCE The current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates
      the significance of bats as reservoirs for severe viral diseases. However, as
      bats are difficult to establish as animal models, bat cell lines can be an
      important proxy for the investigation of bat-virus interactions and the isolation
      of bat-borne viruses. This study demonstrates the susceptibility and
      permissiveness of a continuous kidney bat cell line to SARS-CoV-2. This does not 
      implicate the bat species Rhinolophus lepidus, where these cells originate from, 
      as a potential reservoir, but emphasizes the usefulness of this cell line for
      further characterization of SARS-CoV-2. This can lead to a better understanding
      of emerging viruses that could cause significant disease in humans and domestic
      animals.

TI  - Genomic determinants of Furin cleavage in diverse European SARS-related bat
      coronaviruses.
PG  - 491
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03421-w [doi]
AB  - The furin cleavage site (FCS) in SARS-CoV-2 is unique within the Severe acute
      respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SrC) species. We re-assessed diverse
      SrC from European horseshoe bats and analyzed the spike-encoding genomic region
      harboring the FCS in SARS-CoV-2. We reveal molecular features in SrC such as
      purine richness and RNA secondary structures that resemble those required for FCS
      acquisition in avian influenza viruses. We discuss the potential acquisition of
      FCS through molecular mechanisms such as nucleotide substitution, insertion, or
      recombination, and show that a single nucleotide exchange in two European
      bat-associated SrC may suffice to enable furin cleavage. Furthermore, we show
      that FCS occurrence is variable in bat- and rodent-borne counterparts of human
      coronaviruses. Our results suggest that furin cleavage sites can be acquired in
      SrC via conserved molecular mechanisms known in other reservoir-bound RNA viruses
      and thus support a natural origin of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - White-nose syndrome has killed millions of bats, yet both the origins and
      infection strategy of the causative fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, remain 
      elusive. We provide evidence for a novel hypothesis that P. destructans emerged
      from plant-associated fungi and retained invasion strategies affiliated with
      fungal pathogens of plants. We demonstrate that P. destructans invades bat skin
      in successive biotrophic and necrotrophic stages (hemibiotrophic infection), a
      mechanism previously only described in plant fungal pathogens. Further, the
      convergence of hyphae at hair follicles suggests nutrient tropism. Tropism,
      biotrophy, and necrotrophy are often associated with structures termed
      appressoria in plant fungal pathogens; the penetrating hyphae produced by P.
      destructans resemble appressoria. Finally, we conducted a phylogenomic analysis
      of a taxonomically diverse collection of fungi. Despite gaps in genetic sampling 
      of prehistoric and contemporary fungal species, we estimate an 88% probability
      the ancestral state of the clade containing P. destructans was a plant-associated
      fungus.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the utility of ISTH-BAT (International Society on
      Thrombosis and Hemostasis- Bleeding Assessment Tool) in the diagnosis of
      Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT) in comparison to controls. Methods: It was a
      case-control study carried out at The Children's Hospital, Lahore from January
      2012 to May 2021. All patients from neonates to 18 years with a final diagnosis
      of GT were studied retrospectively. The clinical details were collected from
      hospital records and telephonically on ISTH-BAT questionnaire after taking
      informed consent. The same proforma was obtained from 75 healthy controls. Data
      was analyzed on SPSS version 26. Results: Out of 427 patients with suspected
      platelet function disorders, 133 were diagnosed as GT. The mean age was 7.29+/-5 
      years. Male to female ratio was 1.1:1. Among cases, 76.6% were products of
      consanguineous marriage. Epistaxis was the commonest symptom with highest score
      (p value<0.001). Cutaneous and oral cavity bleeds were more severe and frequent
      in patients than controls (p value < 0.004). The median ISTH-BAT score among
      patients was nine while in control group was one. Sensitivity was 86.4%,
      specificity was 77.3%, positive predictive value was 0.87 and negative predictive
      value was 0.76. Area under the receiver operator curve was 0.78 (95% confidence
      interval 0.82-0.90, p< 0.001*). Conclusion: ISTH-BAT scores were significantly
      higher in GT patients than controls. So, we recommend the inclusion of ISTH-BAT
      in diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected Glanzmann Thrombasthenia.

TI  - Climate Anomalies and Spillover of Bat-Borne Viral Diseases in the Asia-Pacific
      Region and the Arabian Peninsula.
LID - 1100 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14051100 [doi]
AB  - Climate variability and anomalies are known drivers of the emergence and
      outbreaks of infectious diseases. In this study, we investigated the potential
      association between climate factors and anomalies, including El Nino Southern
      Oscillation (ENSO) and land surface temperature anomalies, as well as the
      emergence and spillover events of bat-borne viral diseases in humans and
      livestock in the Asia-Pacific region and the Arabian Peninsula. Our findings from
      time series analyses, logistic regression models, and structural equation
      modelling revealed that the spillover patterns of the Nipah virus in Bangladesh
      and the Hendra virus in Australia were differently impacted by climate
      variability and with different time lags. We also used event coincidence analysis
      to show that the emergence events of most bat-borne viral diseases in the
      Asia-Pacific region and the Arabian Peninsula were statistically associated with 
      ENSO climate anomalies. Spillover patterns of the Nipah virus in Bangladesh and
      the Hendra virus in Australia were also significantly associated with these
      events, although the pattern and co-influence of other climate factors differed. 
      Our results suggest that climate factors and anomalies may create opportunities
      for virus spillover from bats to livestock and humans. Ongoing climate change and
      the future intensification of El Nino events will therefore potentially increase 
      the emergence and spillover of bat-borne viral diseases in the Asia-Pacific
      region and the Arabian Peninsula.

TI  - Two Novel Iflaviruses Discovered in Bat Samples in Washington State.
LID - 994 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050994 [doi]
AB  - Arthropods are integral to ecosystem equilibrium, serving as both a food source
      for insectivores and supporting plant reproduction. Members of the Iflaviridae
      family in the order Picornavirales are frequently found in RNA sequenced from
      arthropods, who serve as their hosts. Here we implement a metagenomic deep
      sequencing approach followed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) on viral 
      RNA isolated from wild and captured bat guano in Washington State at two separate
      time points. From these samples we report the complete genomes of two novel
      viruses in the family Iflaviridae. The first virus, which we call King virus, is 
      46% identical by nucleotide to the lethal honeybee virus, deformed wing virus,
      while the second virus which we call Rolda virus, shares 39% nucleotide identity 
      to deformed wing virus. King and Rolda virus genomes are 10,183 and 8934
      nucleotides in length, respectively. Given these iflaviruses were detected in
      guano from captive bats whose sole food source was the Tenebrio spp. mealworm, we
      anticipate this invertebrate may be a likely host. Using the NCBI Sequence Read
      Archive, we found that these two viruses are located in six continents and have
      been isolated from a variety of arthropod and mammalian specimens.

TI  - Henipavirus Immune Evasion and Pathogenesis Mechanisms: Lessons Learnt from
      Natural Infection and Animal Models.
LID - 936 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050936 [doi]
AB  - Nipah henipavirus (NiV) and Hendra henipavirus (HeV) are zoonotic emerging
      paramyxoviruses causing severe disease outbreaks in humans and livestock, mostly 
      in Australia, India, Malaysia, Singapore and Bangladesh. Both are bat-borne
      viruses and in humans, their mortality rates can reach 60% in the case of HeV and
      92% for NiV, thus being two of the deadliest viruses known for humans. Several
      factors, including a large cellular tropism and a wide zoonotic potential,
      con-tribute to their high pathogenicity. This review provides an overview of HeV 
      and NiV pathogenicity mechanisms and provides a summary of their interactions
      with the immune systems of their different host species, including their natural 
      hosts bats, spillover-hosts pigs, horses, and humans, as well as in experimental 
      animal models. A better understanding of the interactions between henipaviruses
      and their hosts could facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies
      and vaccine measures against these re-emerging viruses.

TI  - Chirohepevirus from Bats: Insights into Hepatitis E Virus Diversity and
      Evolution.
LID - 905 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14050905 [doi]
AB  - Homologs of the human hepatitis E virus (HEV) have been identified in more than a
      dozen animal species. Some of them have been evidenced to cross species barriers 
      and infect humans. Zoonotic HEV infections cause chronic liver diseases as well
      as a broad range of extrahepatic manifestations, which increasingly become
      significant clinical problems. Bats comprise approximately one-fifth of all named
      mammal species and are unique in their distinct immune response to viral
      infection. Most importantly, they are natural reservoirs of several highly
      pathogenic viruses, which have induced severe human diseases. Since the first
      discovery of HEV-related viruses in bats in 2012, multiple genetically divergent 
      HEV variants have been reported in a total of 12 bat species over the last
      decade, which markedly expanded the host range of the HEV family and shed light
      on the evolutionary origin of human HEV. Meanwhile, bat-borne HEV also raised
      critical public health concerns about its zoonotic potential. Bat HEV strains
      resemble genomic features but exhibit considerable heterogeneity. Due to the
      close evolutionary relationships, bat HEV altogether has been recently assigned
      to an independent genus, Chirohepevirus. This review focuses on the current state
      of bat HEV and provides novel insights into HEV genetic diversity and molecular
      evolution.

TI  - Blood Parasites and Health Status of Hibernating and Non-Hibernating Noctule Bats
      (Nyctalus noctula).
LID - 1028 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10051028 [doi]
AB  - Co-existence of bats with a wide range of infectious agents relates to their
      co-evolutionary history and specific physiology. Here, we examined blood samples 
      collected during hibernation and the post-hibernation period to assess the
      influence of trypanosomes and babesias on the health status of 50 Noctule bats
      (Nyctalus noctula) using nested PCR. The impact of blood parasites on health was 
      assessed by analysis of haematology and blood chemistry parameters in 21 bats.
      Prevalence of trypanosomes (Trypanosoma dionisii and T. vespertilionis) and
      babesia (Babesia vesperuginis) was 44% and 8%, respectively. Analysis of blood
      parameters indicated impact of babesia on acid-base balance. Blood chemistry
      parameters showed a significant decrease in total dissolved carbon dioxide and
      bicarbonate, increased anion gap, and no change in blood pH, suggesting
      compensated metabolic acidosis. Adverse effects of babesia were only apparent in 
      hibernating bats. Our results suggest differences in the pathogenicity of
      trypanosomes and babesia in bats. While trypanosomes in general had no
      significant impact on the health status, we observed alterations in the blood
      acid-base balance in Babesia-infected bats during hibernation. Despite being
      infected, Babesia-positive bats survived hibernation without showing any clinical
      signs.

TI  - PET/MRI-Evaluated Activation of Brown Adipose Tissue via Cold Exposure Impacts
      Lipid Metabolism.
LID - 456 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12050456 [doi]
AB  - Although brown adipose tissue (BAT) is considered to play a protective role
      against obesity and type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms of its activation and
      associations with clinical parameters are not well described. Male adults
      underwent a 2 h cold exposure (CE) to activate BAT and, based on the results of
      PET/MRI performed after the CE, were divided into BAT(+) and BAT(-) groups.
      During the CE procedure, blood samples were collected and alterations in plasma
      metabolome in both groups were investigated using LC-MS. Additionally,
      associations between clinical factors and BAT were examined. Moreover, levels of 
      glucose, insulin, leptin, TNF-alpha, FGF21, and FABP4 were assessed in serum
      samples. In the BAT(+) group, levels of LPC(17:0), LPE(20:4), LPE(22:4),
      LPE(22:6), DHA, linoleic acid, and oleic acid increased during CE, whereas levels
      of sphinganine-phosphate and sphingosine-1-phosphate decreased. Levels of
      LPE(O-18:0), 9-HpODE, and oleic acid were elevated, while the level of LPE(20:5) 
      was reduced in BAT(+) compared to BAT(-) subjects. AUCs of LPC(18:2),
      LPC(O-18:2)/LPC(P-18:1), and SM(d32:2) negatively correlated with BAT. In the
      BAT(+) group, the concentration of FABP4 during and after CE was decreased
      compared to the basal level. No alterations were observed in the BAT(-) group. In
      conclusion, using untargeted metabolomics, we proved that the plasma metabolome
      is affected by cold-induced BAT activation.

TI  - Severe Muscle Deconditioning Triggers Early Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and
      Resident Stem Cell Differentiation into Adipocytes in Healthy Men.
LID - 5489 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23105489 [doi]
AB  - Besides the loss of muscle mass and strength, increased intermuscular adipose
      tissue (IMAT) is now a well-recognized consequence of muscle deconditioning as
      experienced in prolonged microgravity. IMAT content may alter the muscle stem
      cell microenvironment. We hypothesized that extracellular matrix structure
      alterations and microenvironment remodeling induced by fast and severe muscle
      disuse could modulate fibro-adipogenic progenitor fate and behavior. We used the 
      dry immersion (DI) model that rapidly leads to severe muscle deconditioning due
      to drastic hypoactivity. We randomly assigned healthy volunteers (n = 18 men) to 
      the control group (only DI, n = 9; age = 33.8 +/- 4) or to the DI + thigh cuff
      group (n = 9; age = 33.4 +/- 7). Participants remained immersed in the supine
      position in a thermo-neutral water bath for 5 days. We collected vastus lateralis
      biopsies before (baseline) and after DI. 5 days of DI are sufficient to reduce
      muscle mass significantly, as indicated by the decreased myofiber cross-sectional
      area in vastus lateralis samples (-18% vs. baseline, p &lt; 0.05). Early and late
      adipogenic differentiation transcription factors protein levels were upregulated.
      Platelet-derived growth Factors alpha (PDGFR) protein level and PDGFR-positive
      cells were increased after 5 days of DI. Extracellular matrix structure was prone
      to remodeling with an altered ECM composition with 4 major collagens,
      fibronectin, and Connective Tissue Growth Factor mRNA decreases (p &lt; 0.001 vs.
      baseline). Wearing thigh cuffs did not have any preventive effect on the measured
      variable. Our results show that altered extracellular matrix structure and
      signaling pathways occur early during DI, a severe muscle wasting model, favoring
      fibro-adipogenic progenitor differentiation into adipocytes.

TI  - Transplantation of Brown Adipose Tissue with the Ability of Converting Omega-6 to
      Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Counteracts High-Fat-Induced Metabolic
      Abnormalities in Mice.
LID - 5321 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23105321 [doi]
AB  - A balanced omega (omega)-6/omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) ratio has 
      been linked to metabolic health and the prevention of chronic diseases. Brown
      adipose tissue (BAT) specializes in energy expenditure and secretes signaling
      molecules that regulate metabolism via inter-organ crosstalk. Recent studies have
      uncovered that BAT produces different PUFA species and circulating oxylipin
      levels are correlated with BAT-mediated energy expenditure in mice and humans.
      However, the impact of BAT omega-6/omega-3 PUFAs on metabolic phenotype has not
      been fully elucidated. The Fat-1 transgenic mice can convert omega-6 to omega-3
      PUFAs. Here, we demonstrated that mice receiving Fat-1 BAT transplants displayed 
      better glucose tolerance and higher energy expenditure. Expression of genes
      involved in thermogenesis and nutrient utilization was increased in the
      endogenous BAT of mice receiving Fat-1 BAT, suggesting that the transplants may
      activate recipients' BAT. Using targeted lipidomic analysis, we found that the
      levels of several omega-6 oxylipins were significantly reduced in the circulation
      of mice receiving Fat-1 BAT transplants than in mice with wild-type BAT
      transplants. The major altered oxylipins between the WT and Fat-1 BAT
      transplantation were omega-6 arachidonic acid-derived oxylipins via the
      lipoxygenase pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest an important role of
      BAT-derived oxylipins in combating obesity-related metabolic disorders.

TI  - The Effect of Nutritional Ketosis on Aquaporin Expression in Apolipoprotein
      E-Deficient Mice: Potential Implications for Energy Homeostasis.
LID - 1159 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10051159 [doi]
AB  - Ketogenic diets (KDs) are very low-carbohydrate, very high-fat diets which
      promote nutritional ketosis and impact energetic metabolism. Aquaporins (AQPs)
      are transmembrane channels that facilitate water and glycerol transport across
      cell membranes and are critical players in energy homeostasis. Altered AQP
      expression or function impacts fat accumulation and related comorbidities, such
      as the metabolic syndrome. Here, we sought to determine whether nutritional
      ketosis impacts AQPs expression in the context of an atherogenic model. To do
      this, we fed ApoE(-/-) (apolipoprotein E-deficient) mice, a model of human
      atherosclerosis, a KD (Kcal%: 1/81/18, carbohydrate/fat/protein) or a control
      diet (Kcal%: 70/11/18, carbohydrate/fat/protein) for 12 weeks. Plasma was
      collected for biochemical analysis. Upon euthanasia, livers, white adipose tissue
      (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were used for gene expression studies. Mice
      fed the KD and control diets exhibited similar body weights, despite the
      profoundly different fat contents in the two diets. Moreover, KD-fed mice
      developed nutritional ketosis and showed increased expression of thermogenic
      genes in BAT. Additionally, these mice presented an increase in Aqp9 transcripts 
      in BAT, but not in WAT, which suggests the participation of Aqp9 in the influx of
      excess plasma glycerol to fuel thermogenesis, while the up-regulation of Aqp7 in 
      the liver suggests the involvement of this aquaporin in glycerol influx into
      hepatocytes. The relationship between nutritional ketosis, energy homeostasis,
      and the AQP network demands further investigation.

      allergic reactions.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/s13223-022-00685-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main barriers to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is the
      fear of developing hypersensitivity reactions to any of its components. Although 
      these reactions are very rare, it is necessary to establish an effective protocol
      to detect patients at risk of developing them. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate hypersensitivity reactions in vaccinated patients in order to allow or
      not to complete the vaccination protocol. METHODS: Descriptive and
      cross-sectional study in which patients with suspected hypersensitivity to
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were evaluated. All patients underwent skin prick test (SPT) 
      and/or intradermal test (IDT) with the vaccines and their excipients. In patients
      with positive IDT with the vaccine, a histopathological and immunohistochemical
      study was performed by skin biopsy. A basophil activation test (BAT) and a
      lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT) were also performed. RESULTS: Sixteen
      patients with suspected hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (12 received
      Comirnaty((R)), 3 received Vaxzevria((R)), and 1 received Spikevax((R))) were
      evaluated. Half had immediate hypersensitivity reactions and half had delayed
      reactions. All SPTs to excipients and vaccines were negative. IDTs with all
      excipients were negative. IDTs with vaccines were positive in 11 patients and
      negative in 5. The histological and immunohistochemical study of the two selected
      patients with positive IDT with vaccine showed T-lymphocyte involvement. BAT and 
      LTT were negative in both cases. The vaccination protocol could be completed in 7
      of 16 patients (44%) studied. The remaining 9 patients did not receive the second
      dose: 5 because vaccination was not required and 4 because they refused to be
      vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to the allergological and immunohistochemical
      study, the vaccination protocol could be completed in about half of the patients 
      who presented suspected hypersensitivity reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. IDTs
      with vaccines could be a valuable method for assessing the immunogenicity of the 
      vaccines.

      interaction network analysis MCODE and CytoHubba, 55 up-regulated hub genes from 
      four clusters and 9 down-regulated genes were identified. The up-regulated hub
      genes were mainly enriched in brown adipocyte differentiation, extracellular
      matrix organization, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. The
      enrichment of downregulated hub genes was related to NRF2 signalling and
      glutathione metabolism, indicating that oxidative stress also plays a role.
      Analysis of overlapping down-regulated genes, targets of transcription factors,
      revealed enrichment in the IL-18 signalling pathway, which is involved in
      browning process and extracellular matrix organization via actomyosin mechanics
      and integrin-extracellular matrix interactions. Finally, the comparison
      transcriptomic analysis with the gene signature reported by BATLAS and PROFAT
      web-based tools showed an increased percentage of the brown phenotype, confirming
      that differentiated SGBS cells at D06, D08, and D10 gradually acquire BAT-like
      function.

TI  - Universality of Torpor Expression in Bats.
PG  - 326-339
LID - 10.1086/720273 [doi]
AB  - AbstractAlthough heterothermy is employed by species at a global level within the
      order of Chiroptera (bats), the possibility of torpor being expressed in bat
      species inhabiting warmer climate zones has been explored only in the past couple
      decades. Recent studies suggest that the benefit of expressing torpor is not
      limited to saving energy during cold exposure or food shortage but may be just as
      important for saving water during heat waves. Thus, even if the physiological
      challenges faced by bats may depend on the habitat they live in, species
      expressing torpor should be found in any climate zone where employing torpor may 
      yield benefits and increase their survival probability. Here, we summarize
      available data on torpor metabolic rates and daily skin temperature patterns of
      bats across climate zones, emphasizing similarities found in the data. We also
      present data that we have collected from a southern subtropical species
      (Nyctophilus bifax) and a northern subarctic species (Plecotus auritus) to
      illustrate specific examples of torpor expressions in two bat species living in
      highly different environments. Our findings highlight that torpor metabolic rates
      and skin temperature patterns of bats outside of the hibernation season can be
      universal across vastly different habitats, although arid environments indicate
      potential divergence in mean minimum torpor metabolic rates compared with
      measurements of populations inhabiting other climate zones.

TI  - Distinct morphology of cardiac- and brown adipose tissue-projecting neurons in
      the stellate ganglia of mice.
PG  - e15334
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15334 [doi]
AB  - Sympathetic neurons that innervate the heart are located primarily in the
      stellate ganglia (SG), which also contains neurons that project to brown adipose 
      tissue (BAT). These studies were designed to examine the morphology of these two 
      populations (cardiac- and BAT-projecting) and their target connectivity. We
      examined SG neurons in C57BL/6J mice following injections of the retrograde
      tracer cholera toxin B (CTb) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 555,
      into cardiac tissue and intrascapular BAT. BAT-projecting SG neurons were widely 
      dispersed in SG, while cardiac-projecting SG neurons were localized primarily
      near the inferior cardiac nerve base. SG neurons were not dual-labeled,
      suggesting that sympathetic innervation is specific to the heart and BAT,
      supporting the idea of "labeled lines" of efferents. Morphologically,
      cardiac-projecting SG somata had more volume and were less abundant than
      BAT-projecting neurons using our tracer-labeling paradigm. We found a positive
      correlation between the number of primary dendrites per neuron and soma volume in
      cardiac-projecting SG neurons, though not in BAT-projecting neurons. In both SG
      subpopulations, the number of cholinergic inputs marked with vesicular
      acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) puncta contacting the soma was positively
      correlated to soma volume, suggesting scaling of inputs across a range of
      neuronal sizes. In separate studies using dual tracing from left and right BAT,
      we found that BAT-projecting SG neurons were located predominately ipsilateral to
      the injection, but a small subset of SG neurons project bilaterally to BAT. This 
      tracing approach will allow the assessment of cell-specific mechanisms of
      plasticity within subpopulations of SG neurons.

AB  - Bats have evolved behavioral specializations that are unique among mammals,
      including self-propelled flight and echolocation. However, areas of motor cortex 
      that are critical in the generation and fine control of these unique behaviors
      have never been fully characterized in any bat species, despite the fact that
      bats compose approximately 25% of extant mammalian species. Using intracortical
      microstimulation, we examined the organization of motor cortex in Egyptian fruit 
      bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a species that has evolved a novel form of
      tongue-based echolocation.(1)(,)(2) We found that movement representations
      include an enlarged tongue region containing discrete subregions devoted to
      generating distinct tongue movement types, consistent with their behavioral
      specialization generating active sonar using tongue clicks. This magnification of
      the tongue in motor cortex is comparable to the enlargement of somatosensory
      representations in species with sensory specializations.(3-5) We also found a
      novel degree of coactivation between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, both of which
      are involved in altering the shape and tension of wing membranes during flight.
      Together, these findings suggest that the organization of motor cortex has
      coevolved with peripheral morphology in bats to support the unique motor demands 
      of flight and echolocation.

TI  - Diversity of CRESS DNA Viruses in Squamates Recapitulates Hosts Dietary and
      Environmental Sources of Exposure.
PG  - e0078022
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00780-22 [doi]
AB  - Replication-associated protein (Rep)-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses
      comprise viruses with covalently closed, circular, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
      genomes, and are considered the smallest known autonomously replicating,
      capsid-encoding animal pathogens. CRESS DNA viruses (phylum Cressdnaviricota)
      encompass several viral families including Circoviridae. Circoviruses are
      classified into two genera, Circovirus and Cyclovirus, and they are known to
      cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs. Circoviruses have also been identified in
      human stools, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as in various wild
      and domestic vertebrates, including reptiles. The synanthropic presence of
      Squamata reptiles has increased in the last century due to the anthropic
      pressure, which has shifted forested animal behavior to an urban and peri-urban
      adaptation. In this paper, we explored the diversity of CRESS DNA viruses in
      Squamata reptiles from different Italian areas representative of the
      Mediterranean basin. CRESS DNA viruses were detected in 31.7% (33/104) of sampled
      lizards and geckoes. Different CRESS DNA viruses likely reflected dietary
      composition or environmental contamination and included avian-like (n = 3), dog
      (n = 4), bat-like (n = 1), goat-like (n = 1), rodent-like (n = 4), and
      insect-like (n = 2) viruses. Rep sequences of at least two types of
      human-associated cycloviruses (CyV) were identified consistently, regardless of
      geographic location, namely, TN9-like (n = 11) and TN12-like (n = 6). A third
      human-associated CyV, TN25-like, was detected in a single sample. The complete
      genome of human-like CyVs, of a rodent-like, insect-like, and of a bat-like virus
      were generated. Collectively, the results recapitulate hosts dietary and
      environmental sources of exposure and may suggest unexpected ecological niches
      for some CRESS DNA viruses. IMPORTANCE CRESS DNA viruses are significant
      pathogens of birds and pigs and have been detected repeatedly in human samples
      (stools, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid), both from healthy individuals and from 
      patients with neurological disease, eliciting in 2013 a risk assessment by the
      European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Sequences of CRESS DNA
      viruses previously reported in humans (TN9, TN12, and TN25), and detected in
      different animal species (e.g., birds, dogs, and bats) were herein detected in
      fecal samples of synanthropic squamates (geckos and lizards). The complete genome
      sequence of six viruses was generated. This study extends the information on the 
      genetic diversity and ecology of CRESS DNA viruses. Because geckos and lizards
      are synanthropic animals, a role in sustaining CRESS DNA virus circulation and
      increasing viral pressure in the environment is postulated.

AB  - The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      Omicron variant, sublineages BA.1 and BA.2, recently became the dominant variants
      of concern (VOCs) with significantly higher transmissibility than any other
      variant appeared and markedly greater resistance to neutralization antibodies and
      original ancestral WA1 spike-matched vaccine. Therefore, it is urgent to develop 
      vaccines against VOCs like Omicron. Unlike the new booming messenger RNA (mRNA)
      vaccine, protein vaccines have been used for decades to protect people from
      various kinds of viral infections and have advantages with their inexpensive
      production protocols and their relative stability in comparison to the mRNA
      vaccine. Here, we show that sera from BA.1 spike protein vaccinated mice mainly
      elicited neutralizing antibodies against BA.1 itself. However, a booster with
      BA.1 spike protein or a bivalent vaccine composed of D614G and BA.1 spike
      protein-induced not only potent neutralizing antibody response against D614G and 
      BA.1 pseudovirus, but also against BA.2, other four SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (Alpha, Beta,
      Gamma, and Delta) and SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses (pangolin CoV GD-1 and bat
      CoV RsSHC014). The two recombinant spike protein vaccines method described here

AB  - The black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) is a natural reservoir for Hendra virus, a
      paramyxovirus that causes fatal infections in humans and horses in Australia.
      Increased excretion of Hendra virus by flying foxes has been hypothesized to be
      associated with physiological or energetic stress in the reservoir hosts. The
      objective of this study was to explore the leukocyte profiles of wild-caught P.
      alecto, with a focus on describing the morphology of each cell type to facilitate
      identification for clinical purposes and future virus spillover research. To this
      end, we have created an atlas of images displaying the commonly observed
      morphological variations across each cell type. We provide quantitative and
      morphological information regarding the leukocyte profiles in bats captured at
      two roost sites located in Redcliffe and Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia, over
      the course of two years. We examined the morphology of leukocytes, platelets, and
      erythrocytes of P. alecto using cytochemical staining and characterization of
      blood films through light microscopy. Leukocyte profiles were broadly consistent 
      with previous studies of P. alecto and other Pteropus species. A small proportion
      of individual samples presented evidence of hemoparasitic infection or leukocyte 
      morphological traits that are relevant for future research on bat health,
      including unique large granular lymphocytes. Considering hematology is done by
      visual inspection of blood smears, examples of the varied cell morphologies are
      included as a visual guide. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the
      first qualitative assessment of P. alecto leukocytes, as well as the first set of
      published hematology reference images for this species.

AB  - Global changes in response to human encroachment into natural habitats and carbon
      emissions are driving the biodiversity extinction crisis and increasing disease
      emergence risk. Host distributions are one critical component to identify areas
      at risk of viral spillover, and bats act as reservoirs of diverse viruses. We
      developed a reproducible ecological niche modelling pipeline for bat hosts of
      SARS-like viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), given that several closely related
      viruses have been discovered and sarbecovirus-host interactions have gained
      attention since SARS-CoV-2 emergence. We assessed sampling biases and modelled
      current distributions of bats based on climate and landscape relationships and
      project future scenarios for host hotspots. The most important predictors of
      species distributions were temperature seasonality and cave availability. We
      identified concentrated host hotspots in Myanmar and projected range contractions
      for most species by 2100. Our projections indicate hotspots will shift east in
      Southeast Asia in locations greater than 2 degrees C hotter in a fossil-fuelled
      development future. Hotspot shifts have implications for conservation and public 
      health, as loss of population connectivity can lead to local extinctions, and
      remaining hotspots may concentrate near human populations.

AB  - The basophil activation test (BAT) has emerged as a reliable complementary
      diagnostic to document IgE-dependent allergies and to study cross-reactivity
      between structural homologues. However, the BAT has some weaknesses that hinder a
      wider application. The BAT requires fresh blood samples and is lost as a
      diagnostic in patients showing a non-responder status of their cells. The BAT is 
      difficult to standardize mainly because of the difficulty to perform batch
      analyses. In contrast, mast cell activation tests (MATs), using passively
      sensitized mast cells (MCs) with patients' sera (henceforth indicated as passive 
      MAT; pMAT), use serum samples that can be frozen, stored, and shipped to a
      reference center experienced in MC lines and/or cultures and capable of offering 
      batch testing. With the recent recognition of the Mas-related G protein-coupled
      receptor X2 (MRGPRX2) occupation as a putative mechanism of immediate drug
      hypersensitivity reactions, the MAT has another advantage compared to the BAT.
      MCs, in contrast to resting basophils, express the MRGPRX2 and can therefore be
      used to study this IgE-independent mechanism. This review provides a status
      update of pMAT in the diagnosis of allergic IgE-mediated hypersensitivity and
      speculates how direct activation of MCs via the MRGPRX2 receptor could advance
      paradigms for this non-allergic hypersensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Models of anxiety disorders and the rationale of exposure therapy
      (ET) are grounded on classical fear conditioning. Yet, it is unclear whether
      lower fear ratings of conditioned safety versus threat cues and corresponding
      neural markers of safety-learning and/or fear inhibition assessed before
      treatment would predict better outcomes of behavioral exposure. METHODS:
      Sixty-six patients with spider phobia completed pre-treatment clinical and
      experimental fear conditioning assessments, one session of virtual reality ET, a 
      post-treatment clinical assessment, and a 6-month follow-up assessment. Tilted
      Gabor gratings served as conditioned stimuli (CS) that were either paired (CS+)
      or remained unpaired (CS-) with an aversive phobia-related and phobia-unrelated
      unconditioned stimulus (UCS). CS+/CS- differences in fear ratings and
      magnetoencephalographic event-related fields (ERFs) were related to percentual
      symptom reductions from pre- to post-treatment, as assessed via spider phobia
      questionnaire (SPQ), behavioral avoidance test (BAT), and remission status at
      6-month follow-up. RESULTS: We observed no associations between pre-treatment
      CS+/CS- differences in fear ratings and any treatment outcome. CS+/CS-
      differences in source estimations of ERFs revealed that higher CS- activity in
      bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was related with SPQ- and
      BAT-reductions. Associations between CS+/CS- differences and treatment outcomes
      were also observed in left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) regions, which 
      additionally revealed associations with the follow-up remission status.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results provide initial evidence that neural pre-treatment CS+/CS-
      differences may hold predictive information regarding outcomes of behavioral
      exposure. Our findings highlight a key role of neural responses to safety cues
      with potentially inhibitory effects on affect-generating structures during fear
      conditioning.

AB  - Although rotavirus vaccines are available in many parts of the world and are
      effective in reducing the overall incidence of rotavirus infection, it remains a 
      major cause of diarrhea in less-developed countries. Among various rotavirus
      group A (RVA) strains, the increasingly common genotype G3 (defined by the VP7
      gene) has been identified in both humans and animals. Our previous
      epidemiological surveillance in Bangkok found several unusual non-vaccine-like G3
      strains in patients with diarrhea. In this study, we sequenced and characterized 
      the genomes of seven of these G3 strains, which formed combinations with
      genotypes P[4], P[6], P[9], and P[10] (defined by the VP4 gene). Interestingly,
      we identified a bat-like RVA strain with the genome constellation
      G3-P[10]-I3-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which has not been previously reported in
      the literature. The amino acid residues deduced from the nucleotide sequences of 
      our G3 strains differed at the antigenic epitopes to those of the VP7 capsid
      protein of the G3 strain in RotaTeq vaccine. Although it is not unusual for the
      segmented genomes of RVA to reassort and give rise to emerging novel strains, the
      atypical G3 strains identified in this study suggest possible animal-to-human RVA
      zoonotic spillover even in urban areas.

TI  - Divergent Rabies Virus Variant of Probable Bat Origin in 2 Gray Foxes, New
      Mexico, USA.
PG  - 1137-1145
LID - 10.3201/eid2806.211718 [doi]
AB  - In the Western Hemisphere, bat-associated rabies viruses (RABVs) have established
      independent transmission cycles in multiple mammal hosts, forming genetically
      distinct lineages. In New Mexico, USA, skunks, bats, and gray foxes are rabies
      reservoir hosts and represent a public health risk because of encounters with
      humans. During 2015 and 2019, two previously undescribed RABVs were detected in 2
      gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) in Lincoln County, New Mexico. Phylogenetic
      analysis of the nucleoprotein gene indicated that the isolates are a novel RABV
      variant. These 2 cases probably represent repeated spillover events from an
      unknown bat reservoir to gray foxes. Molecular analysis of rabies cases across
      New Mexico identified that other cross-species transmission events were the
      result of viral variants previously known to be enzootic to New Mexico. Despite a
      robust rabies public health surveillance system in the United States, advances in
      testing and surveillance techniques continue to identify previously unrecognized 
      zoonotic pathogens.

TI  - Renal peritumoral adipose tissue undergoes a browning process and stimulates the 
      expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in human renal cells.
PG  - 8687

AB  - Tumor cells can interact with neighboring adipose cells and adipocyte
      dedifferentiation appears to be an important aspect of tumorigenesis. We
      evaluated the size of adipocytes in human adipose explants from normal (hRAN) and
      kidney cancer (hRAT); changes in the expression of WAT and BAT/beige markers in
      hRAN and hRAT; the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) cell
      markers in human kidney tumor (786-O, ACHN and Caki-1); and non-tumor (HK-2)
      epithelial cell lines incubated with the conditioned media (CMs) of hRAN and
      hRAT. We observed that hRAT adipocytes showed a significantly minor size compared
      to hRAN adipocytes. Also, we observed that both Prdm16 and Tbx1 mRNA and the
      expression of UCP1, TBX1, PPARgamma, PCG1alpha, c/EBPalpha LAP and c/EBPalpha LIP
      was significantly higher in hRAT than hRAN. Finally, we found an increase in
      vimentin and N-cadherin expression in HK-2 cells incubated for 24 h with hRAT-CMs
      compared to hRAN- and control-CMs. Furthermore, desmin and N-cadherin expression 
      also increased significantly in 786-O when these cells were incubated with
      hRAT-CMs compared to the value observed with hRAN- and control-CMs. We observed a
      significant decrease in E-cadherin expression in the ACHN cell line incubated
      with hRAT-CMs versus hRAN- and control-CMs. However, we did not observe changes
      in E-cadherin expression in HK-2, 786-O or Caki-1. The results obtained, together
      with the results previously published by our group, allow us to conclude that
      perirenal white adipose tissue browning contributes to tumor development in
      kidney cancer. In addition, hRAT-CMs increases the expression of mesenchymal
      markers in renal epithelial cells, which could indicate a regulation of EMT due
      to this adipose tissue.

AB  - We evaluated the morphometric variation of wing mite Periglischrus paracaligus
      Herrin and Tipton, along with the distribution of their host Leptonycteris
      yerbabuenae Martinez and Villa, in Mexico. A total of 115 female and 96 male
      specimens of P. paracaligus were used to conduct linear and geometric
      morphometric analyses. We assessed the influence of the geographic distribution
      of the migratory and nonmigratory populations of its bat host species on changes 
      in size and shape on these parasites. Both analyses revealed high intraspecific
      variation in P. paracaligus, but subtle geographic differentiation. None of the
      approaches used identified a consistent pattern that separates unambiguously
      migratory from nonmigratory populations. Females presented more phenotypic
      variation than males and UPGMA analyses showed southern and northern colonies
      grouped in two distinct clades. Males on the other hand showed randomly grouped
      colonies with no geographic concordance. Interestingly, the most differentiated
      colony was the north Pacific colony of Jalisco. For both, males and females,
      isolation by distance (IBD) was not observed. We discuss these results as a
      possible scenario of contact between migratory populations located in northern
      Mexico with nonmigratory populations in other localities in central and southern 
      Mexico conforming to a panmictic population along with their distribution range.

TI  - Muscle-Derived Beige Adipose Precursors Secrete Promyogenic Exosomes That Treat
      Rotator Cuff Muscle Degeneration in Mice and Are Identified in Humans by
      Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Muscle atrophy, fibrosis, and fatty infiltration are common to a
      variety of sports-related and degenerative conditions and are thought to be
      irreversible. Fibroadipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are multipotent resident muscle 
      stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into fibrogenic as well as white
      and beige adipose tissue (BAT). FAPs that have assumed a BAT differentiation
      state (FAP-BAT) have proven efficacious in treating muscle degeneration in
      numerous injury models. PURPOSE: To characterize the subpopulation of murine FAPs
      with FAP-BAT activity, determine whether their promyogenic effect is mediated via
      exosomes, and analyze human FAPs for an analogous promyogenic exosome-rich
      subpopulation. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: FAPs from UCP1
      reporter mice were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting and sorted
      according to the differential intensity of the UCP1 signal observed: negative for
      UCP1 (UCP1-), intermediate intensity (UCP1+), and high intensity (UCP1++). Bulk
      RNA sequencing was performed on UCP1-, UCP1+, and UCP1++ FAPs to evaluate
      distinct characteristics of each population. Exosomes were harvested from UCP1++ 
      FAP-BAT exosomes (Exo-FB) as well as UCP1- non-FAP-BAT exosomes (Exo-nFB) cells
      using cushioned-density gradient ultracentrifugation and used to treat C2C12
      cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro, and the myotube fusion index was 
      assessed. Exo-FB and Exo-nFB were then used to treat wild type C57B/L6J mice that
      had undergone a massive rotator cuff tear. At 6 weeks mice were sacrificed, and
      supraspinatus muscles were harvested and analyzed for muscle atrophy, fibrosis,
      fatty infiltration, and UCP1 expression. Single-cell RNA sequencing was then
      performed on FAPs isolated from human muscle that were treated with the
      beta-agonist formoterol or standard media to assess for the presence of a
      parallel promyogenic subpopulation of FAP-BAT cells in humans. RESULTS: Flow
      cytometry analysis of sorted UCP1 reporter mouse FAPs revealed a trimodal
      distribution of UCP1 signal intensity, which correlated with 3 distinct
      transcriptomic profiles characterized with bulk RNA sequencing. UCP1++ cells were
      marked by high mitochondrial gene expression, BAT markers, and exosome surface
      makers; UCP1- cells were marked by fibrogenic markers; and UCP1+ cells were
      characterized differential enrichment of white adipose tissue markers. Exo-FB
      treatment of C2C12 cells resulted in robust myotube fusion, while treatment of
      mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in differentiation into myotubes. Treatment 
      of cells with Exo-nFB resulted in poor myotube formation. Mice that were treated 
      with Exo-FB at the time of rotator cuff injury demonstrated markedly reduced
      muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration as compared with treatment with Exo-nFB or 
      phosphate-buffered saline. Single-cell RNA sequencing of human FAPs from the
      rotator cuff revealed 6 distinct subpopulations of human FAPs, with one
      subpopulation demonstrating the presence of UCP1+ beige adipocytes with a
      distinct profile of BAT, mitochondrial, and extracellular vesicle-associated
      markers. CONCLUSION: FAP-BAT cells form a subpopulation of FAPs with upregulated 
      beige gene expression and exosome production that mediate promyogenic effects in 
      vitro and in vivo, and they are present as a transcriptomically similar
      subpopulation of FAPs in humans. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: FAP-BAT cells and their
      exosomes represent a potential therapeutic avenue for treating rotator cuff
      muscle degeneration.

TI  - Global response of conservationists across mass media likely constrained bat
      persecution due to COVID-19.

AB  - Most people lack direct experience with wildlife and form their risk perception
      primarily on information provided by the media. The way the media frames news may
      substantially shape public risk perception, promoting or discouraging public
      tolerance towards wildlife. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, bats were
      suggested as the most plausible reservoir of the virus, and this became a
      recurrent topic in media reports, potentially strengthening a negative view of
      this ecologically important group. We investigated how media framed bats and
      bat-associated diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing the 
      content of 2651 online reports published across 26 countries, to understand how
      and how quickly worldwide media may have affected the perception of bats. We show
      that the overabundance of poorly contextualized reports on bat-associated
      diseases likely increased the persecution towards bats immediately after the
      COVID-19 outbreak. However, the subsequent interventions of different
      conservation communication initiatives allowed pro-conservation messages to
      resonate across the global media, likely stemming an increase in bat persecution.
      Our results highlight the modus operandi of the global media regarding topical
      biodiversity issues, which has broad implications for species conservation.
      Knowing how the media acts is pivotal for anticipating the propagation of
      (mis)information and negative feelings towards wildlife. Working together with
      journalists by engaging in dialogue and exchanging experiences should be central 
      in future conservation management.

AB  - With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), human-assistive technologies in 
      healthcare services have reached the peak of their application in terms of
      diagnosis and treatment process. These devices must be aware of human movements
      to provide better aid in clinical applications as well as the user's daily
      activities. In this context, real-time gait analysis remains to be key catalyst
      for developing intelligent assistive devices. In addition to machine and deep
      learning algorithms, gait recognition systems have significantly improved in
      terms of high accuracy recognition. However, most of the existing models are
      focused on improving gait recognition while ignoring the computational overhead
      that affects the accuracy of detection and even remains unsuitable for real-time 
      implementation. In this research paper, we proposed a hybrid gated recurrent unit
      (GRU) based on BAT-inspired extreme convolutional networks (BAT-ECN) for the
      effective recognition of human activities using gait data. The gait data are
      collected by implanting the wearable Internet of Things (WIoT) devices
      invasively. Then, a novel GRU and ECN networks are employed to extract the
      spatio-temporal features which are then used for classification to realize gait
      recognition. Extensive and comprehensive experimentations have been carried out
      to evaluate the proposed model using real-time datasets and also other benchmarks
      such as whuGait and OU-ISIR datasets. To prove the excellence of the proposed
      learning model, we have compared the model's performance with the other existing 
      hybrid models. Results demonstrate that the proposed model has outperformed the
      other learning models in terms of high gait classification and less computational
      overhead.

AB  - Circadian rhythms play a crucial role in the health and survival of organisms.
      However, little is known concerning how intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect
      animal daily rhythms in the field, especially in nocturnal animals. Here, we
      investigated the first emergence, mid-emergence, and return times of Vespertilio 
      sinensis, and also integrated environmental conditions (temperature, humidity,
      and light intensity) and biotic factors (reproductive status and predation risk) 
      to determine causes of variation in the activity rhythms of the bats. We found
      that variation in the first emergence time, the mid-emergence time, and the final
      return time were distinct. The results demonstrated that the emergence and return
      times of bats were affected by light intensity, reproductive status, and
      predation risk in a relatively complex pattern. Light intensity had the greatest 
      contribution to activity rhythms. Moreover, we first investigated the effects of 
      actual predators on the activity rhythms of bats; the results showed that the
      mid-emergence time of bats was earlier as predators were hunting, but the final
      return time was later when predators were present. Finally, our results also
      highlighted the importance of higher energy demands during the lactation in bats 
      to variation in activity rhythms. These results improve our understanding of the 
      patterns and causes of variation in activity rhythms in bats and other nocturnal 
      animals.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bat-derived
      betacoronavirus, that emerged around December 2019. In spite of the lesser
      genomic diversity of CoVs in general, a steady accumulation of mutations spread
      over its genome have been noted, resulting in the emergence of several clades and
      lineages. Majority of these mutations are random and non-functional changes;
      however a few variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) designated
      by the WHO since late 2020 have implications to diagnostics, pathogenicity and
      immune escape. This review discusses the various nomenclatures depicting the
      SARS-CoV-2 evolution, the designated VOCs and VOIs and the mutations

AB  - Origin of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been intensely debated in the
      scientific community since the first infected cases were detected in December
      2019. The disease has caused a global pandemic, leading to deaths of thousands of
      people across the world and thus finding origin of this novel coronavirus is
      important in responding and controlling the pandemic. Recent research results
      suggest that bats or pangolins might be the hosts for SARS-CoV-2 based on
      comparative studies using its genomic sequences. This paper investigates the
      SARS-CoV-2 origin by using artificial intelligence (AI)-based unsupervised
      learning algorithms and raw genomic sequences of the virus. More than 300 genome 
      sequences of COVID-19 infected cases collected from different countries are
      explored and analysed using unsupervised clustering methods. The results obtained
      from various AI-enabled experiments using clustering algorithms demonstrate that 
      all examined SARS-CoV-2 genomes belong to a cluster that also contains bat and
      pangolin coronavirus genomes. This provides evidence strongly supporting
      scientific hypotheses that bats and pangolins are probable hosts for SARS-CoV-2. 
      At the whole genome analysis level, our findings also indicate that bats are more
      likely the hosts for the COVID-19 virus than pangolins.

AB  - Extensive studies have shown that the increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT)
      mass/activity possesses a strong ability to prevent obesity and its related
      complications. The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) signal pathway is known to play a role in adipocyte
      differentiation and development. However, its impact on thermogenic properties of
      mature brown adipocytes has not yet been clarified. Nifuroxazide (NFX), a potent 
      inhibitor of STAT3, has received widespread attention due to its alternative
      anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects. Herein, we report that NFX induces
      lipolysis with subsequent downregulation of ACCalpha and FAS, while ATGL and pHSL
      levels are elevated in mature brown adipocytes. Furthermore, NFX treatment
      promotes the mitochondrial respiration of mature brown adipocytes, as evidenced
      by increased expression of thermogenic transcriptional factors and mitochondrial 
      content. In addition, it also alleviates the IL-6 and TNFalpha inhibition on
      brown thermogenic programming via suppressing the STAT3/NF-kappaB/IL-6 signaling 
      pathway. In general, these findings suggest that the blockade of the JAK/STAT3
      pathway by NFX has a pro-thermogenic effect on mature brown adipocytes which
      opens new perspectives for NFX repurposing and potential therapeutic route to
      counteract obesity and related metabolic disorders.

TI  - PACT establishes a posttranscriptional brake on mitochondrial biogenesis by
      promoting the maturation of miR-181c.

AB  - The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase activating protein (PACT), an
      RNA-binding protein that is part of the RNA-induced silencing complex, plays a
      key role in miR-mediated translational repression. Previous studies showed that
      PACT regulates the expression of various miRs, selects the miR strand to be
      loaded onto RNA-induced silencing complex, and determines proper miR length.
      Apart from PACT's role in mediating the antiviral response in immune cells, what 
      PACT does in other cell types is unknown. Strikingly, it has also been shown that
      cold exposure leads to marked downregulation of PACT protein in mouse brown
      adipose tissue (BAT), where mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism play a
      central role. Here, we show that PACT establishes a posttranscriptional brake on 
      mitochondrial biogenesis (mitobiogenesis) by promoting the maturation of
      miR-181c, a key suppressor of mitobiogenesis that has been shown to target
      mitochondrial complex IV subunit I (Mtco1) and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). Consistently,
      we found that a partial reduction in PACT expression is sufficient to enhance
      mitobiogenesis in brown adipocytes in culture as well as during BAT activation in
      mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate an unexpected role for PACT in the regulation
      of mitochondrial biogenesis and energetics in cells and BAT.

AB  - Urea provides pathophysiological information on renal and hepatic disorders.
      Among the secretion pathways via several bio-fluids, sweat urea represent an
      important and non-invasive strategy to evaluate kidney and liver pathologies. In 
      this work, a rapid and reliable colorimetric urea bioassay assisted by
      chemometrics design of experiments has been obtained. The sensing method is based
      on the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia catalyzed by urease. If urea is present in
      the sample, the enzymatic reaction leads to an alkaline environment that is
      capable to ruin the structure of Prussian Blue. For the first time Prussian Blue 
      is adopted as a precision pH sensing element. Alkaline solution destroys the
      structure of Prussian Blue, leading to a dramatic colorimetric response from blue
      to colorless. Design of experiments has been adopted to optimize experimental
      setup by evaluating correlation among variables. The colorimetric method was
      shown to be able to detect urea down to 0.05 mM, with a linearity up to 2 mM and 
      a relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 10%. Sweat samples have been
      satisfactorily analyzed, and the high accuracy of the portable device has been
      demonstrated with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis of
      the same sweat samples.

AB  - RBCs demonstrate immunomodulatory capabilities through the expression of nucleic 
      acid sensors. However, little is known about bat RBCs, and no studies have
      examined the immune function of bat erythrocytes. In this study, we show that bat
      RBCs express the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs TLR7 and TLR9 and bind the nucleic
      acid ligands, ssRNA, and CpG DNA. Collectively, these data suggest that, like
      human RBCs, bat erythrocytes possess immune function and may be reservoirs for
      nucleic acids. These findings provide unique insight into bat immunity and may
      uncover potential mechanisms by which virulent pathogens of humans are concealed 
      in bats.

TI  - The relationship of antipsychotic treatment with reduced brown adipose tissue
      activity in patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic drug (APD) treatment has been associated with metabolic
      abnormalities. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the main site of adaptive
      thermogenesis and secretes various metabolism-improving factors known as
      batokines. We explored the association of BAT activity with APD treatment and
      metabolic abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia by measuring the blood
      levels of bone morphogenetic protein 8b (BMP8b), a batokine secreted by mature
      BAT. METHODS: BMP8b levels were compared among 50 drug-free, 32
      aripiprazole-treated, and 91 clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia.
      Regression analysis was used to explore factors, including APD types, that might 
      be associated with BMP8b levels and the potential effect of BMP8b on metabolic
      syndrome (MS). RESULTS: APD-treated patients had decreased BMP8b levels relative 
      to drug-free patients. The difference still existed after adjustment for body
      mass index and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. Among APD-treated group,
      clozapine was associated with even lower BMP8b levels than the less obesogenic
      APD, aripiprazole. Furthermore, higher BMP8b levels were associated with lower
      risks of MS after adjustment for BMI and APD treatment. CONCLUSION: Using
      drug-free patients as the comparison group to understand the effect of APDs, this
      is the first study to show APD treatment is associated with reduced BAT activity 
      that is measured by BMP8b levels, with clozapine associated a more significant
      reduction than aripiprazole treatment. BMP8b might have a beneficial effect
      against metabolic abnormalities and this effect is independent of APD treatment. 
      Future studies exploring the causal relationship between APD treatment and BMP8b 
      levels and the underlying mechanisms are warranted.

TI  - Myeloid p38 activation maintains macrophage-liver crosstalk and BAT thermogenesis
      through IL-12-FGF21 axis.
LID - 10.1002/hep.32581 [doi]
AB  - Obesity features excessive fat accumulation in several body tissues and induces a
      state of chronic low-grade inflammation that contributes to the development of
      diabetes, steatosis, and insulin resistance. Recent research has shown that this 
      chronic inflammation is crucially dependent on p38 pathway activity in
      macrophages, suggesting p38 inhibition as a possible treatment for obesity
      comorbidities. Nevertheless, we report here that lack of p38 activation in
      myeloid cells worsens high-fat diet-induced obesity, diabetes, and steatosis.
      Deficient p38 activation increases macrophage IL-12 production, leading to
      inhibition of hepatic FGF21 and reduction of thermogenesis in the brown fat. The 
      implication of FGF21 in the phenotype was confirmed by its specific deletion in
      hepatocytes. We also found that IL-12 correlates with liver damage in human
      biopsies, indicating the translational potential of our results. Our findings
      suggest that myeloid p38 has a dual role in inflammation and that drugs targeting
      IL-12 might improve the homeostatic regulation of energy balance in response to
      metabolic stress.

TI  - Deletion of GPR30 Drives the Activation of Mitochondrial Uncoupling Respiration
      to Induce Adipose Thermogenesis in Female Mice.
PG  - 877152
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.877152 [doi]
AB  - Thermogenic adipocytes possess a promising approach to combat obesity with its
      capability promoting energy metabolism. We previously discovered that deletion of
      GPR30 (GPRKO), a presumably membrane-associated estrogen receptor, protected
      female mice from developing obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance 
      when challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD). In vivo, the metabolic phenotype of
      wild type (WT) and GPRKO female mice were measured weekly. Acute cold tolerance
      test was performed. Ex vivo, mitochondrial respiration of brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) was analyzed from diet-induced obese female mice of both genotypes. In
      vitro, stromal vascular fractions (SVF) were isolated for beige adipocyte
      differentiation to investigate the role of GPR30 in thermogenic adipocyte.
      Deletion of GPR30 protects female mice from hypothermia and the mitochondria in
      BAT are highly energetic in GPRKO animals while the WT mitochondria remain in a
      relatively quiescent stage. Consistently, GPR30 deficiency enhances beige
      adipocyte differentiation in white adipose tissue (WAT) and activates the
      thermogenic browning of subcutaneous WAT due to up-regulation of UCP-1, which
      thereby protects female mice from HFD-induced obesity. GPR30 is a negative
      regulator of thermogenesis, which at least partially contributes to the reduced
      adiposity in the GPRKO female mice. Our findings provide insight into the
      mechanism by which GPR30 regulates fat metabolism and adiposity in female mice
      exposed to excess calories, which may be instrumental in the development of new
      therapeutic strategies for obesity.

TI  - Impacts of seasonality on gene expression in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
PG  - e8923
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8923 [doi]
AB  - Seasonality can cause changes in many environmental factors which potentially
      affects gene expression. Here, we used a bat species (Rhinolophus sinicus) from
      eastern China as a model to explore the molecular mechanisms of seasonal effects,
      in particular during phenological shifts in the spring and autumn. Based on the
      analysis of 45 RNA-seq samples, we found strong seasonal effects on gene
      expression, with a large number of genes identified as either specific or biased 
      to each season. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis also identified
      multiple modules significantly associated with each season. These seasonal genes 
      were further enriched into different functional categories. Consistent with
      effects of phenological shifts on bats, we found that genes related to promoting 
      food intake were highly expressed in both autumn and spring. In addition,
      immunity genes were also highly expressed in both seasons although this seasonal 
      immune response had tissue specificity in different seasons. In female bats,
      genes related to the delay of ovulation (e.g., NPPC, natriuretic peptide
      precursor type C) were highly expressed in October, while genes associated with
      the promotion of reproduction (e.g., DIO2, iodothyronine deiodinase 2) were
      biasedly expressed in April. Lastly, we found multiple known core clock genes in 
      both October-biased and April-biased expressed genes, which may be involved in
      regulating the start and end of hibernation, respectively. Overall, together with
      studies in other land and aquatic animals, our work supports that seasonal gene
      expression variations may be a general evolutionary response to environmental
      changes in wild animals.

AB  - Previous studies have pointed to a role for regional cerebral hemodynamic stress 
      in neurological complications in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), with
      watershed regions identified as particularly at risk of ischemic tissue injury.
      Using single- and multi-inflow time (TI) arterial spin labeling sequences (ASL)
      in 94 patients with SCA and 42 controls, the present study sought to investigate 
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) and bolus arrival times (BAT) across gray matter, white
      matter with early arrival times, and in individual watershed areas (iWSAs). In
      iWSAs, associations between hemodynamic parameters, lesion burden, white matter
      integrity, and general cognitive performance were also explored. In patients,
      increases in CBF and reductions in BAT were observed in association with reduced 
      arterial oxygen content across gray matter and white matter with early arrival
      times using both sequences (all p < 0.001, d = -1.55--2.21). Across iWSAs, there 
      was a discrepancy between sequences, with estimates based on the single-TI
      sequence indicating higher CBF in association with reduced arterial oxygen
      content in SCA patients, and estimates based on the multi-TI sequence indicating 
      no significant between-group differences or associations with arterial oxygen
      content. Lesion burden was similar between white matter with early arrival times 
      and iWSAs in both patients and controls, and using both sequences, only
      trend-level associations between iWSA CBF and iWSA lesion burden were observed in
      patients. Further, using the multi-TI sequence in patients, increased iWSA CBF
      was associated with reduced iWSA microstructural tissue integrity and slower
      processing speed. Taken together, the results highlight the need for researchers 
      to consider BAT when estimating CBF using single-TI sequences. Moreover, the
      findings demonstrate the feasibility of multi-TI ASL for objective delineation of
      iWSAs and for detection of regional hemodynamic stress that is associated with
      reduced microstructural tissue integrity and slower processing speed. This
      technique may hold promise for future studies and treatment trials.

TI  - Transmission of Klebsiella strains and plasmids within and between grey-headed
      flying fox colonies.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16047 [doi]
AB  - The grey-headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) is an endemic Australian
      fruit bat, known to carry zoonotic pathogens. We recently showed they harbour
      bacterial pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae and closely related species in the K.
      pneumoniae species complex (KpSC); however, the dynamics of KpSC transmission and
      gene flow within flying fox colonies are poorly understood. High-resolution
      genome comparisons of 39 KpSC isolates from grey-headed flying foxes identified
      five putative strain transmission clusters (four intra- and one inter-colony).
      The instance of inter-colony strain transmission of K. africana was found between
      two flying fox populations within flying distance, indicating either direct or
      indirect transmission through a common food/water source. All 11 plasmids
      identified within the KpSC isolates showed 73% coverage (mean) and >/=95%
      identity to human-associated KpSC plasmids, indicating gene flow between human
      clinical and grey-headed flying fox isolates. Along with strain transmission,
      inter-species horizontal plasmid transmission between K. pneumoniae and
      Klebsiella africana was also identified within a flying fox colony. Finally,
      genome-scale metabolic models were generated to predict and compare substrate
      usage to previously published KpSC models, from human and environmental sources. 
      These models indicated no distinction on the basis of metabolic capabilities.
      Instead, metabolic capabilities were consistent with population structure and
      ST/lineage.

TI  - TRPC5 deletion in the central amygdala antagonizes high-fat diet-induced obesity 
      by increasing sympathetic innervation.
PG  - 1544-1555
LID - 10.1038/s41366-022-01151-x [doi]
AB  - Transient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) is predominantly distributed in
      the brain, especially in the central amygdala (CeA), which is closely associated 
      with pain and addiction. Although mounting evidence indicates that the CeA is
      related to energy homeostasis, the possible regulatory effect of TRPC5 in the CeA
      on metabolism remains unclear. Here, we reported that the expression of TRPC5 in 
      the CeA of mice was increased under a high-fat diet (HFD). Specifically, the
      deleted TRPC5 protein in the CeA of mice using adeno-associated virus resisted
      HFD-induced weight gain, accompanied by increased food intake. Furthermore, the
      energy expenditure of CeA-specific TRPC5 deletion mice (TRPC5 KO) was elevated
      due to augmented white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) activity. Mechanistically, deficiency of TRPC5 in the CeA boosted
      nonshivering thermogenesis under cold stimulation by stimulating sympathetic
      nerves, as the beta3-adrenoceptor (Adrb3) antagonist SR59230A blocked the effect 
      of TRPC5 KO on this process. In summary, TRPC5 deletion in the CeA alleviated the
      metabolic deterioration of mice fed a HFD, and these phenotypic improvements were
      correlated with the increased sympathetic distribution and activity of adipose
      tissue.

TI  - Detection distances in desert dwelling, high duty cycle echolocators: A test of
      the foraging habitat hypothesis.
PG  - e0268138
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268138 [doi]
AB  - High Duty Cycle (HDC) echolocating bats use high frequency echolocation pulses
      that are clutter resistant, but their high frequencies give them limited range.
      Despite their unique ability to reject background clutter while simultaneously
      detecting fluttering prey, the frequency of their echolocation pulses has a
      strong correlation with level of environmental clutter, lower frequency pulses of
      HDC bats being associated with more open environments. The Foraging Habitat
      Hypothesis (FHH) proposes that the ecological significance of these lower
      frequency pulses in HDC bats in open environments is that they allow longer prey 
      detection distances. To test the FHH, we compared the frequencies, Source Levels 
      (SLs) and detection distances of Rhinolophus capensis, a HDC bat that has been
      shown to vary its call frequency in relation to habitat structure. As a further
      test of the FHH we investigated the SLs and detection distances of Rhinolophus
      damarensis (a heterospecific species that occurs in the same open desert
      environment as R. capensis but echolocates at a higher dominant pulse frequency).
      In the open desert, R. capensis emitted both lower frequency and higher SL pulses
      giving them longer detection distances than R. capensis in the cluttered fynbos. 
      SL contributed more to differences in detection distances in both R. capensis and
      R. damarensis than frequency. In a few instances, R. damarensis achieved similar 
      detection distances to desert-inhabiting R. capensis by emitting much higher SLs 
      despite their average SLs being lower. These results suggest that lower frequency
      echolocation pulses are not a prerequisite for open desert living but may
      increase detection distance while avoiding energetic costs required for high SLs.

AB  - Emotions can be communicated in social contexts through chemosignals contained in
      human body odors. The transmission of positive emotions via these signals has
      received little interest in past research focused mainly on negative emotional
      transmission. Furthermore, how the use of perfumed products might modulate this
      transmission remains poorly understood. To investigate human positive chemical
      communication, we explored the autonomic, verbal, and behavioral responses of
      receivers exposed to body odors of donors having undergone a within-subject
      positive or neutral mood induction procedure. These responses were compared with 
      those obtained after exposure to the same body odors with added fragrance. Our
      findings suggest that positive emotions can be transmitted through body odor.
      They not only induced modifications at the physiological (heart rate) and verbal 
      levels (perceived intensity and familiarity) but also at the behavioral level,
      with an improved performance on creativity tasks. Perfume did not modulate the
      physiological effects and had a synergistic effect on the positive body odor
      ratings (increased perceived differences between the neutral and positive body
      odor).

AB  - Bats are reservoirs of various viruses. The widely distributed cave nectar bat ( 
      Eonycteris spelaea) is known to carry both filoviruses and coronaviruses.
      However, the potential transmission of theses bat viruses to humans is not fully 
      understood. In this study, we tracked 16 E. spelaea bats in Mengla County, Yunnan
      Province, China, using miniaturized GPS devices to investigate their movements
      and potential contact with humans. Furthermore, to determine the prevalence of
      coronavirus and filovirus infections, we screened for the nucleic acids of the
      Mengla virus (MLAV) and two coronaviruses (GCCDC1-CoV and HKU9-CoV) in anal swab 
      samples taken from bats and for antibodies against these viruses in human serum
      samples. None of the serum samples were found to contain antibodies against the
      bat viruses. The GPS tracking results showed that the bats did not fly during the
      daytime and rarely flew to residential areas. The foraging range of individual
      bats also varied, with a mean cumulative nightly flight distance of 25.50 km and 
      flight speed of up to 57.4 km/h. Taken together, these results suggest that the
      risk of direct transmission of GCCDC1-CoV, HKU9-CoV, and MLAV from E. spelaea
      bats to humans is very low under natural conditions.

TI  - Swine coronaviruses (SCoVs) and their emerging threats to swine population,
      inter-species transmission, exploring the susceptibility of pigs for SARS-CoV-2
      and zoonotic concerns.
PG  - 125-147
LID - 10.1080/01652176.2022.2079756 [doi]
AB  - Swine coronaviruses (SCoVs) are one of the most devastating pathogens affecting
      the livelihoods of farmers and swine industry across the world. These include
      transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
      (PEDV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine hemagglutinating
      encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus
      (SADS-CoV), and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV). Coronaviruses infect a wide
      variety of animal species and humans because these are having single stranded-RNA
      that accounts for high mutation rates and thus could break the species barrier.
      The gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems are the primary organ
      systems affected by SCoVs. Infection is very common in piglets compared to adult 
      swine causing high mortality in the former. Bat is implicated to be the origin of
      all CoVs affecting animals and humans. Since pig is the only domestic animal in
      which CoVs cause a wide range of diseases; new coronaviruses with high zoonotic
      potential could likely emerge in the future as observed in the past. The recently
      emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),
      causing COVID-19 pandemic in humans, has been implicated to have animal origin,
      also reported from few animal species, though its zoonotic concerns are still
      under investigation. This review discusses SCoVs and their epidemiology,
      virology, evolution, pathology, wildlife reservoirs, interspecies transmission,
      spill-over events and highlighting their emerging threats to swine population.
      The role of pigs amid ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will also be discussed. A
      thorough investigation should be conducted to rule out zoonotic potential of
      SCoVs and to design appropriate strategies for their prevention and control.

TI  - A Class of Shark-Derived Single-Domain Antibodies can Broadly Neutralize
      SARS-Related Coronaviruses and the Structural Basis of Neutralization and Omicron
      Escape.
PG  - e2200387
LID - 10.1002/smtd.202200387 [doi]
AB  - The identification of a novel class of shark-derived single domain antibodies,
      named vnarbodies that show picomolar affinities binding to the receptor binding
      domain (RBD) of Wuhan and Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Delta, Delta-plus, and Lambda
      variants, is reported. Vnarbody 20G6 and 17F6 have broad neutralizing activities 
      against all these SARS-CoV-2 viruses as well as other sarbecoviruses, including
      Pangolin coronavirus and Bat coronavirus. Intranasal administration of 20G6
      effectively protects mice from the challenges of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Beta
      variants. 20G6 and 17F6 contain a unique "WXGY" motif in the complementary
      determining region 3 that binds to a hidden epitope on RBD, which is highly
      conserved in sarbecoviruses through a novel beta-sheet interaction. It is found
      that the S375F mutation on Omicron RBD disrupts the structure of beta-strand,
      thus impair the binding with 20G6. The study demonstrates that shark-derived
      vnarbodies offer a prophylactic and therapeutic option against most SARS-CoV-2
      variants and provide insights into antibody evasion by the Omicron variant.

AB  - Thermoregulation is the physiological process by which an animal regulates body
      temperature in response to its environment. It is known that galanin, a
      neuropeptide widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and
      secreted by the gut, plays a role in thermoregulatory behaviors and metabolism.
      We tested the ability of the novel neuropeptide spexin, which shares sequence
      homology to galanin, to regulate these functions in female mice.
      Supraphysiological levels of spexin in C57BL/6 mice did not lead to weight loss
      after 50days of treatment. Behavioral analysis of long-term spexin treatment
      showed it decreased anxiety and increased thermoregulatory nest building, which
      was not observed when mice were housed at thermoneutral temperatures. Treatment
      also disrupted the thermogenic profile of brown and white adipose tissue,
      decreasing mRNA expression of Ucp1 in BAT and immunodetection of beta3-adrenergic
      receptors in gWAT. Our results reveal novel functions for spexin as a modulator
      of thermoregulatory behaviors and adipose tissue metabolism.

TI  - Comparison of Performances of Adalimumab Biosimilars SB5, APB501, GP2017, and
      MSB11022 in Treating Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Real-Life,
      Multicenter, Observational Study.

LID - 10.1093/ibd/izac092 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adalimumab (ADA) biosimilars have entered the therapeutic
      armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), allowing for the treatment of 
      a greater number of patients for their reduced cost than the originator. However,
      comparative data on the efficacy and safety of the various ADA biosimilars
      remains scarce.We compare the efficacy and safety of ADA biosimilars SB5, APB501,
      GP2017, and MSB11022 in treating IBD outpatients in a real-life Italian setting. 
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on consecutive IBD outpatients
      with complete clinical, laboratory, and endoscopic data. Clinical activity was
      measured using the Mayo score in ulcerative colitis (UC) and the Harvey-Bradshaw 
      Index in Crohn's disease (CD). The primary endpoints were the following: (1)
      induction of remission in patients new to biologics and patients new to ADA but
      previously exposed to other anti-tumor necrosis factor agents or other biologics;
      (2) maintenance of remission in patients switched from the ADA originator to an
      ADA biosimilar; and (3) safety of various biosimilars. RESULTS: A total of 533
      patients were enrolled according to the inclusion criteria: 162 patients with UC 
      and 371 patients with CD. Clinical remission was obtained in 79.6% of patients
      new to biologics and 59.2% of patients new to ADA but not to other biologics;
      clinical remission was maintained in 81.0% of patients switched from the
      originator, and adverse events were recorded in 6.7% of patients. There was no
      significant difference between the 4 ADA biosimilars for each predetermined
      endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab biosimilars are effective and safe in IBD
      treatment, both in new patients and in patients switched from the ADA originator.
      No difference in efficacy and safety was found between ADA biosimilars.

AB  - Recent progress in the taxonomy of flat bark beetles (Cucujidae), specifically,
      in the genus Cucujus, has revealed great diversity in subtropical Asia, but the
      seemingly well-known temperate and boreal taxa need further attention because of 
      their conservation status. Here, we used an integrative approach using
      morphology, DNA, and species distribution modelling to disentangle phylogenetic
      relations, verify the number of species, and understand the historical
      biogeography of Palearctic and Nearctic Cucujus beetles, particularly the C.
      haematodes species group. Species distinctiveness was supported for C.
      cinnaberinus, but present-day C. haematodes turned out to be a species complex
      made up of separate lineages in the western, middle and eastern parts of its
      Palearctic range. Cucujus muelleri was a member of that complex, being sister to 
      Asian C. haematodes. Moreover, C. haematodes caucasicus was found to be
      phylogenetically closely related to Italian C. tulliae, and both to be sister to 
      European C. haematodes. North American C. clavipes clavipes and C. c. puniceus
      resulted to be enough divergent to be considered different species.
      Interestingly, western American C. puniceus turned out to be closely related to
      the C. haematodes complex, whereas eastern American C. clavipes constituted a
      separate lineage, being distantly related to both C. puniceus and C.
      cinnaberinus. These patterns suggest former trans-continental connections among
      the ancestors of extant flat bark beetle species. Moreover, a divergent lineage
      of C. cinnaberinus was found in Calabria, which should be regarded at the very
      least as a subspecies. The ancestor of C. hameatodes group originated in
      mid-Miocene, and next, ca. 6.2 Mya, a line leading to C. cinnaberinus had split. 
      Speciation of the American lineages occurred during Pliocene (4.4 Mya for C.
      clavipes and 3.3 Mya for C. puniceus). Species classified as C. haematodes, C.
      tulliae and C. muelleri, as well as distinct lineages within C. cinnaberinus
      split during mid Pleistocene (ca. 1.5 Mya). A comparison of species climatic
      requirements and their present distribution allowed to identify glacial refugia
      in south-eastern areas of North America (C. clavipes), south-western areas of
      North America (C. puniceus), and the Mediterranean and Caspian Sea Basins
      (European Cucujus species), or south-eastern areas of Asia and the foothills of
      the central Asian mountains (eastern C. haematodes). Subsequent climatic changes 
      in the Holocene forced these beetles to move their ranges northwards along the
      coasts of the Pacific (C. puniceus) or Atlantic (C. clavipes), north-eastwards to
      central, northern, and eastern Europe (C. cinnaberinus and European C.
      haematodes) or Siberia (Asian C. haematodes). The combined use of molecular,
      morphological and climatic data allows a comprehensive understanding of the
      phylogenetic relations and past distributions of Cucujus beetles, highlighting
      the complexity of C. haematodes species group evolution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed tomography of the abdomen (CT) is used as the gold standard 
      for detecting solid organ injuries (SOI) after blunt abdominal trauma (BAT).
      However, patient selection for CT is still controversial due to its potential
      risks. In this study, we aimed to investigate the usefulness of laboratory tests 
      in the detection or exclusion of SOI in pediatric patients evaluated in the
      emergency department due to BAT. METHODS: The study was planned as a prospective,
      observational study and was conducted in the emergency department of a university
      hospital between February 2018 and February 2019. Patients under the age of 18
      who were evaluated for BAT in the emergency department were included in the
      study. In the study, the diagnostic value of abnormal laboratory tests in
      detecting SOI was calculated by accepting CT results as the gold standard.
      RESULTS: Of the 323 patients included in the study, 118 (36%) were male. There
      were 283 patients who underwent CT. SOI was detected in 18 (6%) patients.
      Abnormal alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, amylase and lipase
      tests were found to be statistically significant in predicting SOI (p < 0.05).
      However, none of the tests were found to have sufficient sensitivity and
      specificity. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, lactate and base excess values were not
      found to be statistically significant in predicting SOI (p > 0.005). CONCLUSIONS:
      The hematologic laboratory tests are insufficient to rule out solid organ injury 
      in pediatric patient with BAT.

TI  - Bat Dentitions: A Model System for Studies at The Interface of Development,
      Biomechanics, and Evolution.
LID - icac042 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/icb/icac042 [doi]
AB  - The evolution of complex dentitions was a major innovation in mammals that
      facilitated the expansion into new dietary niches that imposed selection for
      tight form-function relationships. Teeth allow mammals to ingest and process food
      items by applying forces produced by a third-class lever system composed by the
      jaw adductors, the cranium, and the mandible. Physical laws determine changes in 
      jaw adductor (biting) forces at different bite point locations along the mandible
      (outlever), thus individual teeth are expected to experience different mechanical
      regimes during feeding. If the mammal dentition exhibits functional adaptations
      to mandible feeding biomechanics, then teeth are expected to have evolved to
      develop mechanically-advantageous sizes, shapes, and positions. Here, we present 
      bats as a model system to test this hypothesis and, more generally, for
      integrative studies of mammal dental diversity. We combine a field-collected
      dataset of bite forces along the tooth row with data on dental and mandible
      morphology across 30 bat species. We (1) describe, for the first time, bite force
      trends along the tooth row of bats, (2) use phylogenetic comparative methods to
      investigate relationships among bite force patterns, tooth and mandible
      morphology, and (3) hypothesize how these biting mechanics patterns may relate to
      the developmental processes controlling tooth formation. We find that bite force 
      variation along the tooth row is consistent with predictions from lever mechanics
      models, with most species having the greatest bite force at the first lower
      molar. The cross-sectional shape of the mandible body is strongly associated with
      the position of maximum bite force along the tooth row, likely reflecting
      mandibular adaptations to varying stress patterns among species. Further, dental 
      dietary adaptations seem to be related to bite force variation along molariform
      teeth, with insectivorous species exhibiting greater bite force more anteriorly, 
      narrower teeth and mandibles, and frugivores/omnivores showing greater bite force
      more posteriorly, wider teeth and mandibles. As these craniodental traits are
      linked through development, dietary specialization appears to have shaped
      intrinsic mechanisms controlling traits relevant to feeding performance.

TI  - Pantothenate protects against obesity via brown adipose tissue activation.
PG  - E69-E79
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00293.2021 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is the primary site of adaptive thermogenesis, which
      is involved in energy expenditure and has received much attention in the field of
      obesity treatment. By screening a small-molecule compound library of drugs
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration, pantothenic acid was identified as 
      being able to significantly upregulate the expression of uncoupling protein 1
      (UCP1), a key thermogenic protein found in BAT. Pantothenate (PA) treatment
      decreased adiposity, reversed hepatic steatosis, and improved glucose homeostasis
      by increasing energy expenditure in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet. PA also
      significantly increased BAT activity and induced beige adipocytes formation.
      Mechanistically, the beneficial effects were mediated by UCP1 because PA
      treatment was unable to ameliorate obesity in UCP1 knockout mice. In conclusion, 
      we identified PA as an effective BAT activator that can prevent obesity and may
      represent a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of obesity and related 
      metabolic diseases.NEW & NOTEWORTHY PA treatment effectively and safely protected
      against obesity via the BAT-UCP1 axis. PA has therapeutic potential for treating 
      obesity and type II diabetes.

TI  - Role of the Steroid Sulfate Uptake Transporter Soat (Slc10a6) in Adipose Tissue
      and 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.
PG  - 863912
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2022.863912 [doi]
AB  - In addition to the endocrine and paracrine systems, peripheral tissues such as
      gonads, skin, and adipose tissue are involved in the intracrine mechanisms
      responsible for the formation of sex steroids via the transformation of
      dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA/DHEAS) into
      potent androgenic and estrogenic hormones. Numerous studies have examined the
      relationship between overweight, central obesity, and plasma levels of DHEA and
      DHEAS. The sodium-dependent organic anion transporter Soat (Slc10a6) is a plasma 
      membrane uptake transporter for sulfated steroids. Significantly increased
      expression of Slc10a6 mRNA has been previously described in organs and tissues of
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, including white adipose tissue. These
      findings suggest that Soat plays a role in the supply of steroids in peripheral
      target tissues. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of Soat in 
      adipocytes and its role in adipogenesis. Soat expression was analyzed in mouse
      white intra-abdominal (WAT), subcutaneous (SAT), and brown (BAT) adipose tissue
      samples and in murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, adipose tissue mass and
      size of the adipocytes were analyzed in wild-type and Slc10a6 (-/-) knockout
      mice. Soat expression was detected in mouse WAT, SAT, and BAT using
      immunofluorescence. The expression of Slc10a6 mRNA was significantly higher in
      3T3-L1 adipocytes than that of preadipocytes and was significantly upregulated by
      exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Slc10a6 mRNA levels were also upregulated
      in the adipose tissue of LPS-treated mice. In Slc10a6 (-/-) knockout mice,
      adipocytes increased in size in the WAT and SAT of female mice and in the BAT of 
      male mice, suggesting adipocyte hypertrophy. The serum levels of adiponectin,
      resistin, and leptin were comparable in wild-type and Slc10a6 (-/-) knockout
      mice. The treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with DHEA significantly reduced lipid
      accumulation, while DHEAS did not have a significant effect. However, following
      LPS-induced Soat upregulation, DHEAS also significantly inhibited lipid
      accumulation in adipocytes. In conclusion, Soat-mediated import of DHEAS and
      other sulfated steroids could contribute to the complex pathways of sex steroid
      intracrinology in adipose tissues. Although in cell cultures the Soat-mediated
      uptake of DHEAS appears to reduce lipid accumulation, in Slc10a6 (-/-) knockout
      mice, the Soat deletion induced adipocyte hyperplasia through hitherto unknown
      mechanisms.

AB  - Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multidomain enzymes in microorganisms that
      synthesize complex, bioactive molecules. PKS II systems are iterative, containing
      only a single representative of each domain: ketosynthase alpha (KS[Formula: see 
      text]), ketosynthase beta and the acyl carrier protein. Any gene encoding for one
      of these domains is representative of an entire PKS II biosynthetic gene cluster 
      (BGC). Bat skin surfaces represent an extreme environment prolific in
      Actinobacteria that may constitute a source for bioactive molecule discovery.
      KS[Formula: see text] sequences were obtained from culturable bacteria from bats 
      in the southwestern United States. From 467 bat bacterial isolates, we detected
      215 (46%) had KS[Formula: see text] sequences. Sequencing yielded 210 operational
      taxonomic units, and phylogenetic placement found 45 (21%) shared <85% homology
      to characterized metabolites. Additionally, 16 Actinobacteria genomes from the
      bat microbiome were analyzed for biosynthetic capacity. A range of 69-93% of the 
      BGCs were novel suggesting the bat microbiome may contain valuable
      uncharacterized natural products. Documenting and characterizing these are
      important in understanding the susceptibility of bats to emerging infectious
      diseases, such as white-nose syndrome. Also noteworthy was the relationship
      between KS [Formula: see text] homology and total BGC novelty within each fully
      sequenced strain. We propose amplification and detection of KS[Formula: see text]
      could predict a strain's global biosynthetic capacity.

TI  - Identification and genome characterization of novel parechovirus sequences from
      Hipposideros armiger in China.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/s12985-022-01806-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bats were identified as a natural reservoir of emerging and
      re-emerging infectious pathogens threatening human health and life. METHODS: This
      study collected 21 fecal samples of Hipposideros armiger in Mengla County of
      Xishuangbanna Prefecture Yunnan Province to combine one pool for viral
      metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: Two nearly complete genomes of parechoviruses,
      BPeV11 and BPeV20, were sequenced. Genome analysis revealed that BPeV11 and
      BPeV20 follow a 3-3-4 genome layout: 5' UTR-VP0-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D-3'
      UTR. The prevalence of BPev11 and BPev20 by Nested-PCR showed that 1 of 21 fecal 
      samples was positive. Based on amino acid identity comparison and phylogenetic
      analysis of P1, 2C, and 3D, BPeV11 and BPeV20 were closely related to but
      distinct from FPeVs. CONCLUSION: It was probably proposed to be a novel species
      in the genus Parechovirus of the family Picornaviridae. The isolation of BPev11
      and BPev20 from H. armiger in China is the first complete genome of parechovirus 
      isolations from bat feces of the genus Hipposideros.

TI  - Ascending aortic perivascular adipose tissue inflammation associates with aortic 
      valve disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ascending aortic perivascular adipose tissue (AA-PVAT) mainly
      comprises brown adipose tissue (BAT), originates from neural crest cells that
      derive from ectoderm, and plays important role in angiotensin II-induced vascular
      inflammation and remodeling in mice. However, the characterization and function
      of human AA-PVAT remains highly unclear. METHODS: Patients with coronary artery
      disease (CAD) (n=20) and aortic valve disease (AVD) (n=23) who underwent cardiac 
      surgery consented to take part in transcriptome and histological studies. Paired 
      samples of AA-PVAT, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and subcutaneous adipose
      tissue (SAT) were obtained. RNA sequencing, histological analysis, quantitative
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot studies were
      performed on those samples. RESULTS: Human AA-PVAT exhibited smaller adipocyte
      morphology and high expression of brown adipocyte marker. Transcriptome analysis 
      revealed that AA-PVAT showed unique transcriptome characteristics compared with
      EAT and SAT. While comparing CAD and AVD patients, AA-PVAT exhibited a decreasing
      brown phenotype and higher inflammatory response in AVD patients. Gene ontology
      enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested
      that the differentially expressed genes in AA-PVAT between CAD and AVD patients
      were involved mainly in the processes of inflammation and metabolism regulation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Human AA-PVAT is a BAT-like adipose tissue with unique transcriptome
      characteristics, and exhibits a weakened brown phenotype and an enhanced
      inflammation response in AVD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remains massively underdiagnosed, due
      to limited access to polysomnography (PSG), the highly complex gold standard for 
      diagnosis. Performance scores in predicting OSA are evaluated for machine
      learning (ML) analysis applied to 3D maxillofacial shapes. METHODS: The 3D
      maxillofacial shapes were scanned on 280 Caucasian men with suspected OSA. All
      participants underwent single night in-home or in-laboratory sleep testing with
      PSG (Nox A1, Resmed, Australia), with concomitant 3D scanning (Sense v2, 3D
      systems corporation, USA). Anthropometric data, comorbidities, medication,
      BERLIN, and NoSAS questionnaires were also collected at baseline. The PSG
      recordings were manually scored at the reference sleep center. The 3D
      craniofacial scans were processed by geometric morphometrics, and 13 different
      supervised algorithms, varying from simple to more advanced, were trained and
      tested. Results for OSAS recognition by ML models were then compared with scores 
      for specificity and sensitivity obtained using BERLIN and NoSAS questionnaires.
      RESULTS: All valid scans (n = 267) were included in the analysis (patient mean
      age: 59 +/- 9 years; BMI: 27 +/- 4 kg/m(2)). For PSG-derived AHI>/=15 events/h,
      the 56% specificity obtained for ML analysis of 3D craniofacial shapes was higher
      than for the questionnaires (Berlin: 50%; NoSAS: 40%). A sensitivity of 80% was
      obtained using ML analysis, compared to nearly 90% for NoSAS and 61% for the
      BERLIN questionnaire. The auROC score was further improved when 3D geometric
      morphometrics were combined with patient anthropometrics (auROC = 0.75).
      CONCLUSION: The combination of 3D geometric morphometrics with ML is proposed as 
      a rapid, efficient, and inexpensive screening tool for OSA. TRIAL REGISTRATION

      Adulthood.

LID - 10.3390/nu14091958 [doi]
AB  - This study investigates the ability of a maternal cafeteria diet during lactation
      to program brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolic responses to an obesogenic diet
      re-exposure in the adult offspring after consuming a standard diet (SD). Nursing 
      rats were fed an SD or a cafeteria diet during lactation. Their offspring (O-C
      and O-CAF, respectively) were weaned onto an SD, and at 16 weeks of age they were
      switched to a Western diet until week 24. Gene and protein expression in BAT were
      measured at PN22 and at 24 weeks. At PN22, compared to controls, O-CAF rats
      displayed lower mRNA levels of lipogenesis-related genes (Fasn), and higher
      expression of genes related to lipolysis (Pnpla2), fatty acid uptake (Cd36, Lpl),
      and oxidation (Cpt1b). Additionally, O-CAF animals displayed increased mRNA
      levels of Adrb3, Ucp1, and Cidea. In adulthood, these animals maintained lower
      mRNA levels of lipogenesis-related genes (Pparg, Srebf1, Fasn), but displayed
      lower expression of genes related to fatty acid uptake (Cd36), fatty acid
      oxidation (Cpt1b), lipolysis (Pnpla2), Adrb3, Ucp1, and Cidea. Thus, exposure to 
      an obesogenic diet in nursing rats can affect long-term lipid metabolism and
      attenuate diet-induced thermogenesis in BAT in response to a new obesogenic
      dietary challenge later in life.

TI  - L-Serine Supplementation Blunts Fasting-Induced Weight Regain by Increasing Brown
      Fat Thermogenesis.
LID - 1922 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14091922 [doi]
AB  - Weight regain after fasting, often exceeding the pre-fasting weight, is a common 
      phenomenon and big problem for the treatment of obesity. Thus, novel
      interventions maintaining reduced body weight are critically important to prevent
      metabolic disease. Here we investigate the metabolic effects of dietary L-serine 
      supplementation, known to modulate various organ functions. C57BL/6N-Rj male mice
      were supplemented with or without 1% L-serine in their drinking water and fed
      with a chow or high-fat diet. Mice were fed either ad libitum or subjected to
      repeated overnight fasting. Body weight, body composition, glucose tolerance and 
      energy metabolism were assessed. This was combined with a detailed analysis of
      the liver and adipose tissues, including the use of primary brown adipocytes to
      study mitochondrial respiration and protein expression. We find that L-serine
      supplementation has little impact on systemic metabolism in ad libitum-fed mice. 
      Conversely, L-serine supplementation blunted fasting-induced body weight regain, 
      especially in diet-induced obese mice. This reduction in body weight regain is
      likely due to the increased energy expenditure, based on elevated brown adipose
      tissue activity. Thus, L-serine supplementation during and after weight-loss
      could reduce weight regain and thereby help tackle one of the major problems of
      current obesity therapies.

TI  - Basophil Activation Test Utility as a Diagnostic Tool in LTP Allergy.
LID - 4979 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094979 [doi]
AB  - Plant-food allergy is an increasing problem, with nonspecific lipid transfer
      proteins (nsLTPs) triggering mild/severe reactions. Pru p 3 is the major
      sensitizer in LTP food allergy (FA). However, in vivo and in vitro diagnosis is
      hampered by the need for differentiating between asymptomatic sensitization and
      allergy with clinical relevance. The basophil activation test (BAT) is an ex vivo
      method able to identify specific IgE related to the allergic response. Thus, we
      aimed to establish the value of BAT in a precise diagnosis of LTP-allergic
      patients. Ninety-two individuals with peach allergy sensitized to LTP, Pru p 3,
      were finally included, and 40.2% of them had symptoms to peanut (n = 37). In
      addition, 16 healthy subjects were recruited. BAT was performed with Pru p 3 and 
      Ara h 9 (peanut LTP) at seven ten-fold concentrations, and was evaluated by flow 
      cytometry, measuring the percentage of CD63 (%CD63(+)) and CD203c (%CD203c(high))
      cells, basophil allergen threshold sensitivity (CD-Sens), and area under the
      dose-response curve (AUC). Significant changes in BAT parameters (%CD63(+) and
      %CD203c(high)) were found between the controls and patients. However, comparisons
      for %CD63(+), %CD203c(high), AUC, and CD-Sens showed similar levels among
      patients with different symptoms. An optimal cut-off was established from ROC
      curves, showing a significant positive percentage of BAT in patients compared to 
      controls and great values of sensitivity (&gt;87.5%) and specificity (&gt;85%).
      In addition, BAT showed differences in LTP-allergic patients tolerant to peanut
      using its corresponding LTP, Ara h 9. BAT can be used as a potential diagnostic
      tool for identifying LTP allergy and for differentiating peanut tolerance,
      although neither reactivity nor sensitivity can distinguish the severity of the
      clinical symptoms.

TI  - Comparison of BMIPP-SPECT/CT to (18)FDG-PET/CT for Imaging Brown or Browning Fat 
      in a Preclinical Model.
LID - 4880 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094880 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and morbidity. To elucidate the
      mechanisms connecting metabolically active brown adipose tissue (BAT) and
      metabolic health may provide insights into methods of treatment for
      obesity-related conditions. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) is traditionally used to image
      human BAT activity. However, the primary energy source of BAT is derived from
      intracellular fatty acids and not glucose. Beta-methyl-p-iodophenylpentadecanoic 
      acid (BMIPP) is a fatty acid analogue amenable to in vivo imaging by single
      photon emission computed tomography/CT (SPECT/CT) when radiolabeled with iodine
      isotopes. In this study, we compare the use of (18)FDG-PET/CT and
      (125)I-BMIPP-SPECT/CT for fat imaging to ascertain whether BMIPP is a more robust
      candidate for the non-invasive evaluation of metabolically active adipose depots.
      Interscapular BAT, inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and gonadal white
      adipose tissue (gWAT) uptake of (18)FDG and (125)I-BMIPP was quantified in mice
      following treatment with the BAT-stimulating drug CL-316,243 or saline vehicle
      control. After CL-316,243 treatment, uptake of both radiotracers increased in BAT
      and iWAT. The standard uptake value (SUVmean) for (18)FDG and (125)I-BMIPP
      significantly correlated in these depots, although uptake of (125)I-BMIPP in BAT 
      and iWAT more closely mimicked the fold-change in metabolic rate as measured by
      an extracellular flux analyzer. Herein, we find that imaging BAT with the
      radioiodinated fatty acid analogue BMIPP yields more physiologically relevant
      data than (18)FDG-PET/CT, and its conventional use may be a pivotal tool for
      evaluating BAT in both mice and humans.

TI  - Molecular and Histological Effects of Glyphosate on Testicular Tissue of the
      Lizard Podarcis siculus.
LID - 4850 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094850 [doi]
AB  - The expansion of agriculture produces a steady increase in habitat fragmentation 
      and degradation due to the increased use of pesticides and herbicides. Habitat
      loss and alteration associated with crop production play an important role in
      reptile decline, among which lizards are particularly endangered. In this study, 
      we evaluated testicular structure, steroidogenesis, and estrogen receptor
      expression/localization after three weeks of oral exposure to glyphosate at 0.05 
      and 0.5 mug/kg body weight every other day in the field lizard Podarcis siculus. 
      Our results show that glyphosate affected testicular morphology, reduced
      spermatogenesis, altered gap junctions and changed the localization of estrogen
      receptors in germ cells, increasing their expression; the effects were mostly
      dose-dependent. The result also demonstrates that glyphosate, at least at these
      concentrations, did not influence steroidogenesis. Overall, the data indicate
      that this herbicide can disturb the morphophysiology of the male lizard's
      reproductive system, with obviously detrimental effects on their reproductive
      fitness. The effects of glyphosate must be considered biologically relevant and
      could endanger the reproductive capacity not only of lizards but also of other
      vertebrates, including humans; a more controlled and less intensive use of
      glyphosate in areas devoted to crop production would therefore be advisable.

TI  - Toxic Effects on Thyroid Gland of Male Adult Lizards (Podarcis Siculus) in
      Contact with PolyChlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)-Contaminated Soil.
LID - 4790 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094790 [doi]
AB  - Skin exposure is considered a potentially significant but little-studied pathway 
      for PolyChlorinated Biphenyls uptake in terrestrial reptiles. In this study, a
      native Italian lizard, Podarcis siculus, was exposed to PCBs-contaminated soil
      for 120 days. Tissues distribution of PCBs, thyroid hormone levels, and thyroid
      histo-physiopathology were examined. The accumulation of PCBs in skin, plasma,
      liver, kidney, and brain were highest at 120 days. The alteration of
      triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels after different concentrations
      and times to exposure of PCBs was accompanied by the changes in the hormones
      involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, namely Thyrotropin
      Releasing Hormone (TRH) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Moreover, hepatic 
      levels of deiodinase II (5'ORDII) and content of T3 were positively correlated to
      exposure to PCBs. These results indicated that in lizards, PCBs exposure through 
      the skin has the potential to disrupt the thyroid endocrine system. Overall, the 
      observed results indicate that PCBs could be associated with changes in thyroid
      homeostasis in these reptiles, through direct interactions with the metabolism of
      T4 and T3 through the HPT axis or indirect interactions with peripheral
      deiodination.

TI  - Many Ways to Rome: Exercise, Cold Exposure and Diet-Do They All Affect BAT
      Activation and WAT Browning in the Same Manner?
LID - 4759 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094759 [doi]
AB  - The discovery of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans and the
      possibility to recruit beige cells with high thermogenic potential within white
      adipose tissue (WAT) depots opened the field for new strategies to combat obesity
      and its associated comorbidities. Exercise training as well as cold exposure and 
      dietary components are associated with the enhanced accumulation of
      metabolically-active beige adipocytes and BAT activation. Both activated beige
      and brown adipocytes increase their metabolic rate by utilizing lipids to
      generate heat via non-shivering thermogenesis, which is dependent on uncoupling
      protein 1 (UCP1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Non-shivering thermogenesis
      elevates energy expenditure and promotes a negative energy balance, which may
      ameliorate metabolic complications of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
      such as insulin resistance (IR) in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Despite
      the recent advances in pharmacological approaches to reduce obesity and IR by
      inducing non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT and WAT, the administered
      pharmacological compounds are often associated with unwanted side effects.
      Therefore, lifestyle interventions such as exercise, cold exposure, and/or
      specified dietary regimens present promising anchor points for future disease
      prevention and treatment of obesity and T2DM. The exact mechanisms where
      exercise, cold exposure, dietary interventions, and pharmacological treatments
      converge or rather diverge in their specific impact on BAT activation or WAT
      browning are difficult to determine. In the past, many reviews have demonstrated 
      the mechanistic principles of exercise- and/or cold-induced BAT activation and
      WAT browning. In this review, we aim to summarize not only the current state of
      knowledge on the various mechanistic principles of diverse external stimuli on
      BAT activation and WAT browning, but also present their translational potential
      in future clinical applications.

TI  - An efficient ANFIS-EEBAT approach to estimate effort of Scrum projects.
PG  - 7974
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11565-2 [doi]
AB  - Software effort estimation is a significant part of software development and
      project management. The accuracy of effort estimation and scheduling results
      determines whether a project succeeds or fails. Many studies have focused on
      improving the accuracy of predicted results, yet accurate estimation of effort
      has proven to be a challenging task for researchers and practitioners,
      particularly when it comes to projects that use agile approaches. This work
      investigates the application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
      along with the novel Energy-Efficient BAT (EEBAT) technique for effort prediction
      in the Scrum environment. The proposed ANFIS-EEBAT approach is evaluated using
      real agile datasets. It provides the best results in all the evaluation criteria 
      used. The proposed approach is also statistically validated using nonparametric
      tests, and it is found that ANFIS-EEBAT worked best as compared to various
      state-of-the-art meta-heuristic and machine learning (ML) algorithms such as
      fireworks, ant lion optimizer (ALO), bat, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and 
      genetic algorithm (GA).

TI  - Pediatric Softball Injuries Presenting to Emergency Departments.
PG  - e1365-e1368
LID - 10.1097/PEC.0000000000002754 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study sought to characterize the mechanisms of injury
      responsible for common softball-related injuries in recent years. METHODS: The
      National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database was queried for all
      pediatric softball-related injuries presenting to participating US emergency
      departments from 2010 to 2019. Patients were classified by age as children (7-12 
      years), adolescents (13-18 years), or young adults (19-21 years). The case
      narrative of each injury was used to establish the mechanism of injury: hit by
      bat, hit by ball, sliding into base, collision with another player, catching,
      running, and throwing. Statistical weights provided by the Consumer Product
      Safety Commission were used to produce national injury estimates. RESULTS: There 
      were an estimated 511,117 pediatric softball injuries presenting to the emergency
      department over the study period, with a mean patient age of 14.3 years (95%
      confidence interval [CI], 14.1-14.4 years). The head/neck was the most commonly
      affected body part, making up 30.2% of cases (95% CI, 28.2%-32.2%). Injuries to
      the head/neck were most often caused by being hit by the ball (78.4%; 95% CI,
      76.4%-80.3%) and most commonly resulted in a superficial injury (36.9%), internal
      injury (22.2%), or concussion (16.3%). Foot/ankle injuries were most frequently
      caused by sliding into base (51.5%; 95% CI, 47.0%-55.2%) and typically resulted
      in a sprain/strain (65.5%). The most frequent causes of shoulder/elbow injuries
      were being hit by the ball (33.3%; 95% CI, 28.6%-38.3%) and throwing the ball
      (27.6%; 95% CI, 22.8%-32.9%). These resulted most frequently in a sprain or
      strain (39.5%), followed by a superficial injury (28.2%). The proportion of
      softball injuries affecting the shoulder and elbow and the lower extremities
      increased with athlete age, whereas the proportion of injuries affecting the
      remainder of the upper extremities decreased with athlete age. CONCLUSION: Being 
      hit by the ball was the most common mechanism of injury, especially in the
      head/neck region, and shoulder/elbow injuries increase with athlete age. Coaches 
      and leagues may consider mandating helmets for infielders and pitch counts for
      pitchers, especially among adolescent athletes.

TI  - Analyzing dynamic species abundance distributions using generalized linear mixed 
      models.
PG  - e3742

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of ecological community dynamics and how they could 
      be affected by environmental changes is important. Population dynamic models have
      well known ecological parameters that describe key characteristics of species
      such as the effect of environmental noise and demographic variance on the
      dynamics, the long-term growth rate, and strength of density regulation. These
      parameters are also central for detecting and understanding changes in
      communities of species; however, incorporating such vital parameters into models 
      of community dynamics is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate how
      generalized linear mixed models specified as intercept-only models with different
      random effects can be used to fit dynamic species abundance distributions. Each
      random effect has an ecologically meaningful interpretation either describing
      general and species-specific responses to environmental stochasticity in time or 
      space, or variation in growth rate and carrying capacity among species. We use
      simulations to show that the accuracy of the estimation depends on the strength
      of density regulation in discrete population dynamics. The estimation of
      different covariance and population dynamic parameters, with corresponding
      statistical uncertainties, is demonstrated for case studies of fish and bat
      communities. We find that species heterogeneity is the main factor of spatial and
      temporal community similarity for both case studies.

TI  - Molecular Evidence of Orthomyxovirus Presence in Colombian Neotropical Bats.
PG  - 845546
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.845546 [doi]
AB  - The Orthomyxoviridae family includes the genera Influenzavirus, Isavirus,
      Quaranjavirus, and Thogotovirus. In turn, Influenzavirus can be classified into
      four types: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta (Formerly A, B, C, and D), from which
      Alphainfluenzavirus (AIV) has the broadest host range, including birds, mammals, 
      reptiles, and amphibians. Additionally, AIV has shown global epidemiological
      relevance owing to its pandemic potential. The epidemiological relevance of
      Chiropteran due to its multiple functional characteristics makes them ideal
      reservoirs for many viral agents. Recently, new influenza-like subtypes have been
      reported in Neotropical bats, but little is known about the relevance of bats as 
      natural reservoirs of influenza viruses. Therefore, the current study aimed to
      determine the presence of AIV and new influenza-like subtypes in South American
      bats. For a better understanding of the drivers and interactions between AIV and 
      bats, we used molecular assays with different gene targets (i.e., M, NP, and PB1)
      to identify AIV in New World bats. A housekeeping gene (CytB) PCR was used to
      check for nucleic acid preservation and to demonstrate the bat-origin of the
      samples. A total of 87 free-living bats belonging to 25 different species of the 
      families Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae were collected in Casanare,
      Colombia. As a result, this study found seven AIV-positive bat species, three of 
      them reported for the first time as AIV prone hosts. Neither of the AIV-like
      analyzed samples were positive for H17N10/H18/N11 subtypes. Although additional
      information is needed, the presence of a completely new or divergent AIV subtype 
      in neotropical bats cannot be discarded. Collectively, the results presented here
      expand the epidemiological knowledge and distribution of AIV in neotropical
      free-ranging bats and emphasize the need to continue studying these viruses to
      establish the role they could play as a threat to animal and public health.

      Gibberellin-Regulated Protein Cross-Reactive With Cry j 7, the
      Gibberellin-Regulated Protein From Japanese Cedar Pollen.
PG  - 328-338
LID - 10.4168/aair.2022.14.3.328 [doi]
AB  - The Capsicum genus belongs to the Solanaceae family. Bell or chili peppers are
      consumed worldwide, but allergy to Capsicum is rare. It is involved in the
      celery-birch-mugwort-spice syndrome and cross-reactivities were reported with
      latex. Several allergens have been described, but only 2 are referenced in the
      World Health Organization/International Union of Immunological Societies allergen
      data bank, a thaumatin-like protein and a profilin. A patient allergic to
      bell/chili pepper, peach, orange and Japanese cedar pollen was clinically and
      biologically analyzed including direct and competitive immunoblots and basophil
      activation tests (BATs) with allergenic source extracts and recombinant
      gibberellin-regulated proteins (GRPs). The patient was shown to be sensitized to 
      Cap a 7, the GRP of Capsicum annuum newly described herein. Cross-reactivities
      were demonstrated between various GRPs from bell/chili pepper, peach, orange and 
      Japanese cedar pollen either in native form in the different extracts or as
      recombinant allergens. A similar immunoglobulin E reactivity was found also in
      Capsicum chinense and against snakin-1, the GRP from potato. The patient showed a
      positive BAT with recombinant Cry j 7, Pru p 7 and Cap a 7, but not with
      recombinant snakin-1. Despite the ubiquitous nature of GRPs in plants and the
      immunochemical cross-reactivity observed between different GRPs, clinically
      relevant sensitization to this protein family seems restricted to some allergenic
      sources, often associated with Cupressaceae pollen allergy, and to some patients,
      therefore reflecting very specific and peculiar mechanisms of conditional
      sensitization.

AB  - The cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, can produce the hepatotoxin
      microcystin. When toxic M. aeruginosa overwinters in the sediments of lakes, it
      may be ingested by aquatic insects and bioaccumulate in nymphs of Hexagenia
      mayflies. When volant Hexagenia emerge from lakes to reproduce, they provide an
      abundant, albeit temporary, food source for many terrestrial organisms including 
      bats. Little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus, feed opportunistically on aquatic
      insects including Hexagenia. To determine if microcystin moves from aquatic to
      terrestrial ecosystems via trophic transfer, we combined a dietary analysis with 
      the quantification of microcystin in bat livers and feces. In June 2014,
      coincident with the local Hexagenia emergence, bat feces were collected from
      underneath a maternity roost near Little Traverse Lake (Leelanau County,
      Michigan, USA). Insects in the diet were identified via molecular analyses of
      fecal pellets from the roost and from individual bats. Livers and feces were
      collected from 19 female M. lucifugus, and the concentrations of microcystin in
      these liver tissues and feces were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS/MS). We show that the majority of the bats' diets consisted of aquatic
      insects and that microcystin was detected in high concentrations (up to 129.9
      mug/kg dw) in the bat feces by ELISA. Histopathological examination of three bat 
      livers with the highest concentrations of microcystin showed no evidence of
      phycotoxicosis, indicating that M. lucifugus may not be immediately affected by
      the ingestion of microcystin. Future work could examine whether bats suffer
      delayed physiological effects from ingestion of microcystin.

AB  - Bilateral arm training (BAT) presents as a promising approach in upper extremity 
      (UE) rehabilitation after a stroke as it may facilitate neuroplasticity. However,
      the effectiveness of BAT is inconclusive, and no systematic reviews and
      meta-analyses have investigated the impact of different factors on the outcomes
      of BAT. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to (1) compare the effects
      of bilateral arm training (BAT) with unilateral arm training (UAT) and
      conventional therapy (CT) on the upper limb (UL) motor impairments and functional
      performance post-stroke, and (2) investigate the different contributing factors
      that may influence the success of BAT. A comprehensive literature search was
      performed in five databases. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that met inclusion 
      criteria were selected and assessed for methodological qualities. Data relating
      to outcome measures, characteristics of participants (stroke chronicity and
      severity), and features of intervention (type of BAT and dose) were extracted for
      meta-analysis. With 25 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria, BAT demonstrated
      significantly greater improvements in motor impairments as measured by Fugl-Meyer
      Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) than CT (MD = 3.94, p = < 0.001), but not 
      in functional performance as measured by the pooled outcomes of Action Research
      Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT), and the time component of Motor
      Function Test (WMFT-time) (SMD = 0.28, p = 0.313). The superior motor impairment 
      effects of BAT were associated with recruiting mildly impaired individuals in the
      chronic phase of stroke (MD = 6.71, p < 0.001), and applying a higher dose of
      intervention (MD = 6.52, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that bilateral
      functional task training (BFTT) improves both motor impairments (MD = 7.84, p <
      0.001) and functional performance (SMD = 1.02, p = 0.049). No significant
      differences were detected between BAT and UAT for motor impairment (MD = -0.90, p
      = 0.681) or functional performance (SMD = -0.09, p = 0.457). Thus, our
      meta-analysis indicates that BAT may be more beneficial than CT in addressing
      post-stroke UL motor impairment, particularly in the chronic phase with mild UL
      paresis. The success of BAT may be dose-dependent, and higher doses of
      intervention may be required. BFTT appears to be a valuable form of BAT that
      could be integrated into stroke rehabilitation programs. BAT and UAT are
      generally equivalent in improving UL motor impairments and functional
      performance.

      a temperate and tropical bat species.

AB  - Endotherms experience temperature variation among body regions, or regional
      heterothermy, despite maintaining high core body temperatures. Bat forelimbs are 
      elongated to function as wings, which makes them vulnerable to heat loss and
      exaggerates regional heterothermy. A tropical bat species, Carollia
      perspicillata, flies with distal wing muscles that are substantially (>10 degrees
      C) cooler than proximal wing muscles and significantly less temperature
      sensitive. We hypothesized that the difference between proximal and distal wing
      muscles would be even more extreme in a temperate bat species that is capable of 
      flight at variable environmental temperatures. We measured the contractile
      properties of the proximal pectoralis muscle and distal extensor carpi radialis
      muscle at a range of temperatures in the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, and
      compared their thermal dependence with that of the same muscles in C.
      perspicillata. We found that, overall, temperature sensitivities between species 
      were remarkably similar. The sole exception was the shortening velocity of the
      pectoralis muscle in E. fuscus, which was less temperature sensitive than in C.
      perspicillata. This decreased temperature sensitivity in a proximal muscle runs
      counter to our prediction. We suggest that the relative lability of body
      temperature in E. fuscus may make better pectoralis function at low temperatures 
      advantageous.

TI  - Gene prediction in the immunoglobulin loci.
PG  - 1152-1169
LID - 10.1101/gr.276676.122 [doi]
AB  - The V(D)J recombination process rearranges the variable (V), diversity (D), and
      joining (J) genes in the immunoglobulin (IG) loci to generate antibody
      repertoires. Annotation of these loci across various species and predicting the
      V, D, and J genes (IG genes) are critical for studies of the adaptive immune
      system. However, because the standard gene finding algorithms are not suitable
      for predicting IG genes, they have been semimanually annotated in very few
      species. We developed the IGDetective algorithm for predicting IG genes and
      applied it to species with the assembled IG loci. IGDetective generated the first
      large collection of IG genes across many species and enabled their evolutionary
      analysis, including the analysis of the "bat IG diversity" hypothesis. This
      analysis revealed extremely conserved V genes in evolutionary distant species,
      indicating that these genes may be subjected to the same selective pressure, for 
      example, pressure driven by common pathogens. IGDetective also revealed extremely
      diverged V genes and a new family of evolutionary conserved V genes in bats with 
      unusual noncanonical cysteines. Moreover, unlike all other previously reported
      antibodies, these cysteines are located within complementarity-determining
      regions. Because cysteines form disulfide bonds, we hypothesize that these
      cysteine-rich V genes might generate antibodies with noncanonical conformations
      and could potentially form a unique part of the immune repertoire in bats. We
      also analyzed the diversity landscape of the recombination signal sequences and
      revealed their features that trigger the high/low usage of the IG genes.

TI  - Histoplasmosis acquired in Alberta, Canada: an epidemiological and genomic study.
PG  - e191-e197

LID - 10.1016/S2666-5247(20)30229-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The classic geographical range of histoplasmosis in North America
      primarily includes the states and provinces adjacent to the Ohio, Mississippi,
      and St Lawrence riverways. Although Alberta, Canada is not typically considered a
      region of risk for histoplasmosis, cases with suspected local acquisition have
      been reported. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and geographical
      distribution of cases of histoplasmosis in Alberta to assess evidence for local
      acquisition of infections, using genomic analysis for corroboration. METHODS: We 
      did an epidemiological and genomic investigation, in which laboratory-confirmed
      cases of histoplasmosis were reviewed in Alberta from 2011, when the disease
      became reportable, until 2018. We used data attained from Alberta Health. Travel 
      and exposure histories and clinical features were reviewed. Definite local
      acquisition was defined as a case without previous travel outside Alberta or
      associated with a common-source outbreak within the province, whereas probable
      local acquisition was a sporadic case with travel outside Alberta but compelling 
      local exposures. Genomes of selected case isolates were analysed, including those
      from cases suspected to have been locally acquired and imported. FINDINGS:
      Between Jan 1, 2011, and June 30, 2018, 45 cases of histoplasmosis were
      identified. Participants had a median age of 53 years (range 17-77) and 32 [71%] 
      were male. Among 34 patients with documented travel histories, ten (29%) had
      never left the province. 11 cases were of definite local acquisition, including
      eight cases from three common-source outbreaks and three sporadic cases in
      patients who had never travelled outside Alberta. The common-source outbreaks all
      involved exposure to bats or their droppings in chimneys or attics of private
      dwellings or churches. Four patients had travelled outside Alberta but compelling
      evidence was seen for local exposure to bat guano. Genome sequencing showed that 
      isolates from cases of definite and probable local acquisition clustered together
      and were genetically distinct from isolates from suspected imported cases and
      other published isolates. INTERPRETATION: Using epidemiological and genomic
      analyses, we established that cases of histoplasmosis have been acquired in
      Alberta, thus expanding the geographical range of Histoplasma spp much further
      northwest than was previously appreciated. Histoplasmosis should be considered in
      patients with compatible symptoms outside areas of classic geographical risk.

      among species and have evolved to deceive predators or prey. Indeed, mimicry has 
      most often evolved to discourage predation: the 'mimic' exhibits phenotypic
      convergence towards a non-related 'model' organism which is inedible or harmful, 
      so that a given predator, or 'receiver', will refrain from attacking or ingesting
      the mimic. Traditionally, mimicry is mainly evident and has been mainly studied
      in the visual domain. Here, we report experiments that document the first case of
      interspecific acoustic mimicry in a mammal and demonstrate that the distress
      calls the greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) broadcasts when handled imitate
      sounds of stinging bees or wasps to discourage the bat's avian predators.

TI  - Major bat-borne zoonotic viral epidemics in Asia and Africa: A systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1787-1801
LID - 10.1002/vms3.835 [doi]
AB  - Bats are the natural reservoir host for many pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      viruses, potentially spilling over to humans and domestic animals directly or via
      an intermediate host. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the continuation of virus 
      spillover events that have taken place over the last few decades, particularly in
      Asia and Africa. Therefore, these bat-associated epidemics provide a significant 
      number of hints, including respiratory cellular tropism, more intense
      susceptibility to these cell types, and overall likely to become a pandemic for
      the next spillover. In this systematic review, we analysed data to insight,
      through bat-originated spillover in Asia and Africa. We used STATA/IC-13 software
      for descriptive statistics and meta-analysis. The random effect of meta-analysis 
      showed that the pooled estimates of case fatality rates of bat-originated viral
      zoonotic diseases were higher in Africa (61.06%, 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, l(2) % = 
      97.3, p < 0.001). Moreover, estimates of case fatality rates were higher in Ebola
      (61.06%; 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, l(2) % = 97.3, p < 0.001) followed by Nipah
      (55.19%; 95%CI: 39.29 to 71.09, l(2) % = 94.2, p < 0.001), MERS (18.49%; 95%CI:
      8.19 to 28.76, l(2) % = 95.4, p < 0.001) and SARS (10.86%; 95%CI: 6.02 to 15.71, 
      l(2) % = 85.7, p < 0.001) with the overall case fatality rates of 29.86 (95%CI:
      29.97 to 48.58, l(2) % = 99.0, p < 0.001). Bat-originated viruses have caused
      several outbreaks of deadly diseases, including Nipah, Ebola, SARS and MERS in
      Asia and Africa in a sequential fashion. Nipah virus emerged first in Malaysia,
      but later, periodic outbreaks were noticed in Bangladesh and India. Similarly,
      the Ebola virus was detected in the African continent with neurological disorders
      in humans, like Nipah, seen in the Asian region. Two important coronaviruses,
      MERS and SARS, were introduced, both with the potential to infect respiratory
      passages. This paper explores the dimension of spillover events within and/or
      between bat-human and the epidemiological risk factors, which may lead to another
      pandemic occurring. Further, these processes enhance the bat-originated virus,
      which utilises an intermediate host to jump into human species.

TI  - Novel brown adipose tissue candidate genes predicted by the human gene
      connectome.
PG  - 7614

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising therapeutic target against obesity.
      Therefore, research on the genetic architecture of BAT could be key for the
      development of successful therapies against this complex phenotype.
      Hypothesis-driven candidate gene association studies are useful for studying
      genetic determinants of complex traits, but they are dependent upon the previous 
      knowledge to select candidate genes. Here, we predicted 107 novel-BAT candidate
      genes in silico using the uncoupling protein one (UCP1) as the hallmark of BAT
      activity. We first identified the top 1% of human genes predicted by the human
      gene connectome to be biologically closest to the UCP1, estimating 167 additional
      pathway genes (BAT connectome). We validated this prediction by showing that 60
      genes already associated with BAT were included in the connectome and they were
      biologically closer to each other than expected by chance (p < 2.2 x 10(-16)).
      The rest of genes (107) are potential candidates for BAT, being also closer to
      known BAT genes and more expressed in BAT biopsies than expected by chance (p <
      2.2 x 10(-16); p = 4.39 x 10(-02)). The resulting new list of predicted human BAT
      genes should be useful for the discovery of novel BAT genes and metabolic
      pathways.

TI  - Leptospira sp. infection in bats: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14589 [doi]
AB  - Bats are the only flying mammalian animals and are distributed worldwide. Bats
      are well-known hosts of several zoonotic viruses and bacteria, including
      Leptospira sp. Here, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of
      evidence of Leptospira sp. infection in bats by examining studies published
      between 1964 and 2021. We reported the frequencies of various species and
      serogroups on all continents, several species and feeding habits of bats, and
      different diagnostic tools. Together, 33 papers from all continents with seven to
      2077 individuals from one to 31 species were included. Molecular detection was
      conducted in most studies, followed by MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test) and
      isolation and identification. Molecular characterization of Leptospira sp.
      revealed L. borgpetersenii as the most frequent species. Moreover, 179 positive
      samples for MAT contained the most likely infecting serogroups described,
      particularly the Australis serogroup. The percentage of positive tests in
      isolation and identification ranged between 0% and 0.5%. The highest frequency of
      Leptospira infection among the continents was observed in Asia, whereas South
      America had the lowest percentage. Finally, Nycteridae and Rhinonycteridae were
      the most frequently infected bat families. Our study provides valuable
      information about the epidemiology of Leptospira sp. infection in bats.

TI  - Is acute appendicitis more severe in foreign workers of northern Israel? A
      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1007/s00068-022-01980-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common surgical
      emergencies worldwide. It's classified into simple or complicated disease. Due to
      the high prevalence of the disease, AA has been studied as a marker to assess the
      quality of care afforded to minority groups. The purpose of this study was to
      compare AA outcomes in foreign workers (FW) to the general population in northern
      Israel. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. We identified all patients
      aged 18-50 who were admitted to our institution between January 1st, 2013 and
      October 31st, 2018, with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The study group
      included all FW and the control group included citizens of Israel. Study patients
      were matched based on age, sex, and co-morbidities. We compared time to
      presentation, admission parameters and disease outcomes. Our study outcomes were 
      disease severity and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: We identified 20 FW and 97
      matched local patients. FW presented with significantly higher heart rate,
      temperature, and white blood cell count (WBC). Duration of symptoms was
      comparable between the two groups. The rates of complicated disease were
      significantly higher among FW (45 vs 17.5%, p < 0.0001). Length of
      hospitalization was significantly longer in the FW group (4.8 vs. 3.9 days, p =
      0.01). The odds ratio of FWs for having a complicated disease was OR = 3.85 [95% 
      CI: 1.38, 10.72], p = 0.01. Multivariate analysis identified FW and duration of
      symptoms as significantly contributing to a complicated disease outcome.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although duration of symptoms was comparable to the local
      population, FW in northern Israel are at increased risk for a complicated disease
      which resulted in longer hospital stay. Further studies may enlighten the reason 
      for this disparity.

      the thermogenic response to cold exposure. In addition, other thermogenic cells
      termed beige adipocytes are generated in white adipose tissue (WAT) by cold
      exposure. Although activation of brown/beige adipose tissue is associated with
      mobilization of both glucose and lipids, few studies have focused on the role of 
      glycolytic enzymes in regulating adipose tissue function. We generated mouse
      models with specific deletion of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 
      (PGAM1) from adipose tissue. Deletion of Pgam1 from both BAT and WAT promoted
      whitening of BAT with beiging of visceral WAT, whereas deletion of Pgam1 from BAT
      alone led to whitening of BAT without beiging of WAT. Our results demonstrate a
      potential role of glycolytic enzymes in beiging of visceral WAT and suggest that 
      PGAM1 would be a novel therapeutic target in obesity and diabetes.

TI  - A novel monoacylglycerol lipase-targeted (18)F-labeled probe for positron
      emission tomography imaging of brown adipose tissue in the energy network.
LID - 10.1038/s41401-022-00912-8 [doi]
AB  - Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) constitutes a serine hydrolase that orchestrates
      endocannabinoid homeostasis and exerts its function by catalyzing the degradation
      of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) to arachidonic acid (AA). As such, selective
      inhibition of MAGL represents a potential therapeutic and diagnostic approach to 
      various pathologies including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases and
      cancers. Based on a unique 4-piperidinyl azetidine diamide scaffold, we developed
      a reversible and peripheral-specific radiofluorinated MAGL PET ligand
      [(18)F]FEPAD. Pharmacokinetics and binding studies on [(18)F]FEPAD revealed its
      outstanding specificity and selectivity towards MAGL in brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) - a tissue that is known to be metabolically active. We employed
      [(18)F]FEPAD in PET studies to assess the abundancy of MAGL in BAT deposits of
      mice and found a remarkable degree of specific tracer binding in the BAT, which
      was confirmed by post-mortem tissue analysis. Given the negative regulation of
      endocannabinoids on the metabolic BAT activity, our study supports the concept
      that dysregulation of MAGL is likely linked to metabolic disorders. Further, we
      now provide a suitable imaging tool that allows non-invasive assessment of MAGL
      in BAT deposits, thereby paving the way for detailed mechanistic studies on the
      role of BAT in endocannabinoid system (ECS)-related pathologies.

TI  - Novel passive detection approach reveals low breeding season survival and
      apparent lactation cost in a critically endangered cave bat.
PG  - 7390
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11404-4 [doi]
AB  - Capture-mark-recapture/resight (CMR) methods are used for survival-rate studies, 
      yet are often limited by small sample sizes. Advances in passive integrated
      transponder (PIT) technology have enabled passive detection or 'resight' of
      marked individuals using large antennas with greater read-ranges than previously 
      possible. We used passively-detected resight data and CMR models to study
      survival rates of the southern bent-winged bat Miniopterus orianae bassanii, a
      critically endangered, cave-dwelling bat. Over three years, we used PIT-tagging
      to monitor 2966 individuals at the species' largest breeding aggregation, using
      daily detection data (> 1.6 million detections) to estimate seasonal survival
      probabilities, structured by age, sex and reproductive status, and parameterise
      population projection matrices. This has hitherto been impossible using
      traditional CMR methods due to disturbance risk and low recapture rates. Bats
      exhibited lowest apparent seasonal survival over summer and autumn, particularly 
      for reproductive females in summer (when lactating) and juveniles in autumn
      (after weaning), and high survival in winter. Lowest survival rates coincided
      with severe drought in summer-autumn 2016, suggesting that dry conditions affect 
      population viability. Under all likely demographic assumptions, population
      projection matrices suggested the population is in deterministic decline,
      requiring urgent action to reduce extinction risk. Passively-collected resight
      data can now be used in combination with CMR models to provide extensive, robust 
      information for targeted wildlife population management.

TI  - Contrasting reproductive traits of competing parasitoids facilitate coexistence
      on a shared host pest in a biological control perspective.
PG  - 3376-3383
LID - 10.1002/ps.6965 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interspecific competition in insect parasitoids is an important
      ecological phenomenon that has relevant implications for biological pest control.
      To date, interspecific intrinsic (=larval) competition has been intensively
      studied, while investigations on extrinsic (=adult) competition have often lagged
      behind. In this study we examined the role played by parasitoid reproductive
      traits and host clutch size on the outcome of extrinsic competition between
      Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) and Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Vassiliev), two egg
      parasitoids of the pest Nezara viridula (L). Laboratory experiments were
      conducted by allowing both parasitoid species to exploit an egg mass made of 10, 
      20, 30, or 40 hosts through single or simultaneous releases. Furthermore, under
      field conditions, egg masses consisting of 10 or 40 hosts were exposed in a
      tomato crop in order to validate laboratory investigation. RESULTS: The results
      show that the egg mass size is an important predictor of extrinsic competition in
      our study system as a higher proportion of T. basalis emerged from large egg
      masses, while O. telenomicida dominated in small egg masses. Analysis of
      reproductive traits of parasitoid species indicates that T. basalis has superior 
      abilities in host exploitation compared with O. telenomicida. CONCLUSIONS: We
      found that contrasting reproductive traits of two competing egg parasitoid
      species facilitate coexistence on a shared stink bug host. This work also
      highlights the importance to consider extrinsic competitive interactions between 
      parasitoid species in a biological control perspective. (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Platelet function testing: Current practice among clinical centres in Northern
      Europe.
PG  - 642-648
LID - 10.1111/hae.14578 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Platelet function tests are used to screen and diagnose patients
      with possible inherited platelet function defects (IPFD). Some acquired platelet 
      dysfunction may be caused by certain drugs or comorbidities, which need to be
      excluded before testing. AIMS: To identify current practice among centres
      performing platelet function tests in Northern Europe. METHODS: A total of 14
      clinical centres from Sweden (six), Finland (two), Denmark (two), Norway (one),
      Estonia (two) and Iceland (one) completed the survey questionnaire, the
      population capture area of about 29.5 million. RESULTS: Six of the 14 (42.8%)
      centres providing platelet function assessment represent comprehensive treatment 
      centres (EUHANET status). A Bleeding score (BS) or ISTH bleeding assessment tool 
      (ISTH BAT score) is evaluated in 11/14 (78.6%) centres and family history in all.
      Five/14 centres (35.7%) use structured preanalytical patient instructions, and
      10/14 (71.4%) recorded questionnaire on the preassessment of avoidance of any
      drugs or natural products affecting platelet functions. Preliminary
      investigations of screening tests of coagulation are performed in 10/14 (71.4%), 
      while in 4/14 (28.6%), the diagnostic work-up of IPFD and von Willebrand disease 
      (VWD) is performed simultaneously. The work-up of IPFD includes peripheral blood 
      smear in 10/14 (71.4%), platelet aggregometry in all, flow cytometry in 10/14
      (71.4%) and Platelet Function Analysis (PFA) in 3/11 (28.6%). Molecular genetic
      diagnosis is available in 7/14 (50%) centres. CONCLUSIONS: The considerable
      variability in the current practice illustrates the need for harmonization
      between the Northern European centres according to the international registers
      (i.e. EUHASS) and IPFD guidelines (ISTH, EHA).

      infections in a neotropical bat.

AB  - Astroviruses (AstVs) infect numerous mammalian species including reservoirs such 
      as bats. Peptides encoded by the genes of the highly polymorphic Major
      Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) form the first line of host defence against
      pathogens. Aside from direct involvement in mounting adaptive immune responses,
      MHC class II genes are hypothesized to regulate gut commensal diversity and shape
      the production of immune-modulatory substances by microbes, indirectly affecting 
      host susceptibility. Despite initial empirical evidence for the link between host
      MHC and the microbiota, associations among these factors remain largely unknown. 
      To fill this gap, we examined MHC allelic diversity and constitution, the gut
      bacterial community and abundance pattern of a wild population of a neotropical
      bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) challenged by AstV infections. First, we show an
      age-dependent relationship between the host MHC class II diversity and
      constitution and the gut microbiota in AstV-uninfected bats. Crucially, these
      associations changed in AstV-infected bats. Additionally, we identify changes in 
      the abundance of specific bacterial taxa linked to the presence of certain MHC
      supertypes and AstV infection. We suggest changes in the microbiota to be either 
      a result of AstV infection or the MHC-mediated modulation of microbial
      communities. The latter could subsequently affect microbe-mediated immunity and
      resistance against AstV infection. Our results emphasize that the reciprocal
      nature of host immune genetics, gut microbial diversity and pathogen infection
      require attention, which are particularly important given their repercussions for
      disease susceptibility and severity in wild animal populations with a history of 
      zoonotic spillover and frequent human contact.

AB  - Imetelstat, a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, demonstrated meaningful
      clinical benefit including a robust symptom response rate and potential overall
      survival benefit in IMbark, a phase II study in intermediate-2 or high-risk
      myelofibrosis (MF) patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to JAK
      inhibitors. We describe the rationale and design for the phase III trial,
      IMpactMF (NCT04576156), an open-label evaluation of imetelstat versus best
      available therapy, excluding JAK inhibitors, in MF patients refractory to JAK
      inhibitor. Imetelstat 9.4 mg/kg is administered as an intravenous infusion every 
      21 days. Primary objective is to assess overall survival. Secondary objectives
      include symptom and spleen responses, progression-free survival, clinical
      response assessment, bone marrow fibrosis reduction, safety and pharmacokinetics.
      Biomarker, cytogenetics and mutation analyses will be performed.

OAB - Imetelstat is a new type of treatment being studied in patients with
      myelofibrosis (MF). Encouraging clinical benefits were seen in a phase II
      clinical trial of imetelstat in higher risk MF. This article discusses the
      ongoing phase III trial, called IMpactMF. IMpactMF is comparing imetelstat to
      best available therapy (BAT) in MF patients not responding to a specific type of 
      treatment, a JAK inhibitor. Imetelstat is an intravenous infusion, given every 21
      days. This study will determine if patients who receive imetelstat live longer
      than patients who are given BAT. It will also collect information on additional
      outcomes, including safety. Trial Registration Number: NCT04576156
      (ClinicalTrials.gov).

TI  - Chronic glucocorticoid exposure causes brown adipose tissue whitening, alters
      whole-body glucose metabolism and increases tissue uncoupling protein-1.
PG  - e15292
LID - 10.14814/phy2.15292 [doi]
AB  - Adipose tissue (AT) has been found to exist in two predominant forms, white and
      brown. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the body's conventional storage organ, and
      brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis which
      allows mammals to produce heat and regulate body temperature. Studies examining
      BAT and its role in whole-body metabolism have found that active BAT utilizes
      glucose and circulating fatty acids and is associated with improved metabolic
      outcomes. While the beiging of WAT is a growing area of interest, the possibility
      of the BAT depot to "whiten" and store more triglycerides also has metabolic and 
      health implications. Currently, there are limited studies that examine the
      effects of chronic stress and its ability to induce a white-like phenotype in the
      BAT depot. This research examined how chronic exposure to the murine stress
      hormone, corticosterone, for 4 weeks can affect the whitening process of BAT in
      C57BL/6 male mice. Separate treatments with mirabegron, a known beta3-adrenergic 
      receptor agonist, were used to directly compare the effects of corticosterone
      with a beiging phenotype. Corticosterone-treated mice had significantly higher
      body weight (p </= 0.05) and BAT mass (p </= 0.05), increased adipocyte area (p
      </= 0.05), were insulin resistant (p </= 0.05), and significantly elevated
      expressions of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) in BAT (p </= 0.05) while
      mitochondrial content remained unchanged. This whitened phenotype has not been
      previously associated with increased uncoupling proteins under chronic stress and
      may represent a compensatory mechanism being initiated under these conditions.
      These findings have implications for the study of BAT in response to chronic
      glucocorticoid exposure potentially leading to BAT dysfunction and negative
      impacts on whole-body glucose metabolism.

      of infectious diseases in bat populations. Journal of Animal Ecology,
      https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13634. Quantifying the transmission of an
      infectious disease is often difficult and for natural animal systems it can be a 
      major challenge. Animals move over time and space changing their degree of
      aggregation and rate of contact, which, in turn, affects the risk of infection
      and the onward spread of the pathogen. Capturing the fundamentals of these
      processes requires the identification of both the correct spatial scale at which 
      the processes take place and what constitutes a meaningful host population unit. 
      Lunn et al. collected data on the gregarious Pteropus (flying foxes) bats from
      roost sites in Australia and investigated whether total bat abundance at the
      roost level, the spatial scale commonly used to model pathogen spread in bat
      populations, was representative of bat measurements at the tree level, the scale 
      at which pathogen transmission between bats most likely occurs. Their findings
      showed that bat population measurements at the sub-plot level were strong
      predictors for potential transmission at the tree scale, while roost-level
      measurements were less robust. This study suggests that bat abundance at roost is
      inadequate to capture the gregarious structure of bat populations and the
      fundamental processes of transmission at lower scale.

TI  - From island biogeography to landscape and metacommunity ecology: A
      macroecological perspective of bat communities.
LID - 10.1111/nyas.14785 [doi]
AB  - The equilibrium theory of island biogeography and its quantitative consideration 
      of origination and extinction dynamics as they relate to island area and distance
      from source populations have evolved over time and enriched theory related to
      many disciplines in spatial ecology. Indeed, the island focus was catalytic to
      the emergence of landscape ecology and macroecology in the late 20th century. We 
      integrate concepts and perspectives of island biogeography, landscape ecology,
      macroecology, and metacommunity ecology, and show how these disciplines have
      advanced the understanding of variation in abundance, biodiversity, and
      composition of bat communities. We leverage the well-studied bat fauna of the
      islands in the Caribbean to illustrate the complex interplay of ecological,
      biogeographical, and evolutionary processes in molding local biodiversity and
      system-wide structure. Thereafter, we highlight the role of habitat loss and
      fragmentation, which is increasing at an accelerating rate during the
      Anthropocene, on the structure of local bat communities and regional
      metacommunities across landscapes. Bat species richness increases with the amount
      of available habitat, often forming nested subsets along gradients of patch or
      island area. Similarly, the distance to and identity of sources of colonization
      influence the richness, composition, and metacommunity structure of islands and
      landscape networks.

TI  - Autistic-like behavioral effects of prenatal stress in juvenile Fmr1 mice: the
      relevance of sex differences and gene-environment interactions.
PG  - 7269
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11083-1 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of mental retardation 
      and monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS is due to a mutation
      in the X-linked FMR1 gene and is characterized by motor, cognitive and social
      alterations, mostly overlapping with ASD behavioral phenotypes. The severity of
      these symptoms and their timing may be exacerbated and/or advanced by
      environmental adversity interacting with the genetic mutation. We therefore
      tested the effects of the prenatal exposure to unpredictable chronic stress on
      the behavioral phenotype of juveniles of both sexes in the Fmr1 knock-out (KO)
      mouse model of FXS. Mice underwent behavioral tests at 7-8 weeks of age, that is,
      when most of the relevant behavioral alterations are absent or mild in Fmr1-KOs. 
      Stress induced the early appearance of deficits in spontaneous alternation in KO 
      male mice, without exacerbating the behavioral phenotype of mutant females. In
      males stress also altered social interaction and communication, but mostly in WT 
      mice, while in females it induced effects on locomotion and communication in mice
      of both genotypes. Our data therefore highlight the sex-dependent relevance of
      early environmental stressors to interact with genetic factors to influence the
      appearance of selected FXS- and ASD-like phenotypes.

TI  - Torso dynamics during follow through in baseball batting.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/14763141.2022.2071328 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between the bat swing
      speed immediately after the ball impact and the dynamics of the torso during the 
      follow through in baseball batting. The batting motion and ground reaction forces
      acting on each foot for 29 collegiate baseball players were recorded using a
      motion capture system and two force plates. The biomechanical variables of the
      torso joint (i.e., the virtual joint that divides the torso between upper and
      lower) were calculated. For right-handed batters, the torque power of the right
      rotation in the torso joint was negative. Additionally, the bat head speed
      immediately after the ball impact was significantly correlated with the negative 
      (i.e., right) peak rotation torque of the torso joint (r = -.635, p < 0.001) and 
      the negative peak power in the right rotation torque of the torso joint (r =
      -.590, p = 0.001). These results suggest that the left external abdominal oblique
      muscle is in eccentric contraction during the follow through in baseball batting.
      Moreover, the results imply that the higher the bat head speed immediately after 
      the ball impact, the higher the possibility to strain the abdominal oblique
      muscle.

TI  - Data-driven modelling of group formation in the fission-fusion dynamics of
      Bechstein's bats.
PG  - 20220170
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2022.0170 [doi]
AB  - Communal roosting in Bechstein's bat colonies is characterized by the formation
      of several groups that use different day roosts and that regularly dissolve and
      re-merge (fission-fusion dynamics). Analysing data from two colonies of different
      sizes over many years, we find that (i) the number of days that bats stay in the 
      same roost before changing follows an exponential distribution that is
      independent of the colony size and (ii) the number and size of groups that bats
      formed for roosting depend on the size of the colony, such that above a critical 
      colony size two to six groups of different sizes are formed. To model these two
      observations, we propose an agent-based model in which agents make their
      decisions about roosts based on both random and social influences. For the
      latter, they copy the roost preference of another agent which models the transfer
      of the respective information. Our model is able to reproduce both the
      distribution of stay length in the same roost and the emergence of groups of
      different sizes dependent on the colony size. Moreover, we are able to predict
      the critical system size at which the formation of different groups emerges
      without global coordination. We further comment on dynamics that bridge the
      roosting decisions on short time scales (less than 1 day) with the social
      structures observed at long time scales (more than 1 year).

TI  - Pseudotyped Bat Coronavirus RaTG13 is efficiently neutralised by convalescent
      sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
PG  - 409
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03325-9 [doi]
AB  - RaTG13 is a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 
      pandemic, sharing 96% sequence similarity at the genome-wide level. The spike
      receptor binding domain (RBD) of RaTG13 contains a number of amino acid
      substitutions when compared to SARS-CoV-2, likely impacting affinity for the ACE2
      receptor. Antigenic differences between the viruses are less well understood,
      especially whether RaTG13 spike can be efficiently neutralised by antibodies
      generated from infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Using RaTG13
      and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes we compared neutralisation using convalescent sera
      from previously infected patients or vaccinated healthcare workers. Surprisingly,
      our results revealed that RaTG13 was more efficiently neutralised than
      SARS-CoV-2. In addition, neutralisation assays using spike mutants harbouring
      single and combinatorial amino acid substitutions within the RBD demonstrated
      that both spike proteins can tolerate multiple changes without dramatically
      reducing neutralisation. Moreover, introducing the 484 K mutation into RaTG13
      resulted in increased neutralisation, in contrast to the same mutation in
      SARS-CoV-2 (E484K). This is despite E484K having a well-documented role in immune
      evasion in variants of concern (VOC) such as B.1.351 (Beta). These results
      indicate that the future spill-over of RaTG13 and/or related sarbecoviruses could
      be mitigated using current SARS-CoV-2-based vaccination strategies.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the greatest threats to biodiversity and
      ecosystem stability, with physiological implications on wild fauna. Bats
      (Microchiroptera) are small mammals with a wide variety of eating habits, and the
      well-being of these animals is disturbed by exposure to pesticides. This study
      aimed to develop a miniaturized QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, 
      and Safe) extraction method for the detection of multi-residue pesticides in bat 
      muscle tissue using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A 
      total of 48 pesticides were tested in 250 mg of bat muscle tissue. The developed 
      analytical method was applied to 148 bats collected from two different areas in
      Minas Gerais State, Southeast Region of Brazil. The method presented good
      sensitivity and allowed the determination of residues of 48 pesticides in bat
      muscle using GC-MS. The miniaturized extraction method makes the analysis
      feasible even when the sample volume is limited. However, no pesticide residues
      were detected in bats from the two areas investigated.

AB  - Canonical non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) in brown and beige fat relies on
      uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated heat generation, although alternative
      mechanisms of NST have been identified, including sarcoplasmic reticulum
      (SR)-calcium cycling. Intracellular calcium is a crucial cell signaling molecule 
      for which compartmentalization is tightly regulated, and the sarco-endoplasmic
      calcium ATPase (SERCA) actively pumps calcium from the cytosol into the SR. In
      this review, we discuss the capacity of SERCA-mediated calcium cycling as a
      significant mediator of thermogenesis in both brown and beige adipocytes. Here,
      we suggest two primary mechanisms of SR calcium mediated thermogenesis. The first
      mechanism is through direct uncoupling of the ATPase and calcium pump activity of
      SERCA, resulting in the energy of ATP catalysis being expended as heat in the
      absence of calcium transport. Regulins, a class of SR membrane proteins, act to
      decrease the calcium affinity of SERCA and uncouple the calcium transport
      function from ATPase activity, but remain largely unexplored in adipose tissue
      thermogenesis. A second mechanism is through futile cycling of SR calcium whereby
      SERCA-mediated SR calcium influx is equally offset by SR calcium efflux,
      resulting in ATP consumption without a net change in calcium
      compartmentalization. A fuller understanding of the functional and mechanistic
      role of calcium cycling as a mediator of adipose tissue thermogenesis and how
      manipulation of these pathways can be harnessed for therapeutic gain remains
      unexplored. Significance Statement Enhancing thermogenic metabolism in brown or
      beige adipose tissue may be of broad therapeutic utility to reduce obesity and
      metabolic syndrome. Canonical BAT-mediated thermogenesis occurs via uncoupling
      protein 1 (UCP1). However, UCP1-independent pathways of thermogenesis, such as
      sarcoplasmic (SR) calcium cycling, have also been identified, but the regulatory 
      mechanisms and functional significance of these pathways remain largely
      unexplored. Thus, this mini-review discusses the state of the field with regard
      to calcium cycling as a thermogenic mediator in adipose tissue.

TI  - Activated brown adipose tissue releases exosomes containing mitochondrial
      methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP dependent) 1-like protein
      (MTHFD1L).

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising weapon to combat obesity and metabolic 
      disease. BAT is thermogenic and consumes substantial amounts of glucose and fatty
      acids as fuel for thermogenesis and energy expenditure. To study BAT function in 
      large human longitudinal cohorts, safe and precise detection methodologies are
      needed. Although regarded a gold standard, the foray of PET-CT into BAT research 
      and clinical applications is limited by its high ionizing radiation doses. Here, 
      we show that brown adipocytes release exosomes in blood plasma that can be
      utilized to assess BAT activity. In the present study, we investigated
      circulating protein biomarkers that can accurately and reliably reflect BAT
      activation triggered by cold exposure, capsinoids ingestion and thyroid hormone
      excess in humans. We discovered an exosomal protein, methylene tetrahydrofolate
      dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1-like (MTHFD1L), to be overexpressed and
      detectable in plasma for all three modes of BAT activation in human subjects.
      This mitochondrial protein is packaged as a cargo within multivesicular bodies of
      the endosomal compartment and secreted as exosomes via exocytosis from activated 
      brown adipocytes into the circulation. To support MTHFD1L as a conserved BAT
      activation response in other vertebrates, we examined a rodent model and also
      proved its presence in blood of rats following BAT activation by cold exposure.
      Plasma concentration of exosomal MTHFD1L correlated with human BAT activity as
      confirmed by PET-MR in humans and supported by data from rats. Thus, we deduce
      that MTHFD1L appears to be overexpressed in activated BAT compared to BAT in the 
      basal nonstimulated state.

TI  - Intraindividual difference between supraclavicular and subcutaneous proton
      density fat fraction is associated with cold-induced thermogenesis.
PG  - 2877-2890
LID - 10.21037/qims-21-986 [doi]
AB  - Background: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity is triggered by cold exposure
      resulting in an increased resting energy expenditure, called cold-induced
      non-shivering thermogenesis (CIT). Magnetic resonance (MR)-based proton density
      fat fraction (PDFF) of the supraclavicular fossa has been proposed as a surrogate
      marker of human BAT. The present study investigates supraclavicular PDFF in
      relation to CIT. Methods: For this prospective cross-sectional study 39 adults
      were recruited, from a cross-sectional study, exploring energy expenditure after 
      cold exposure compared to thermoneutral conditions. Participants underwent
      additional MR examination of neck, pelvis, and abdomen. Supraclavicular and
      subcutaneous gluteal adipose tissue depots were segmented semi-automatically.
      Mean PDFF was assessed for each compartment and the delta PDFF was calculated as 
      the difference of both. Correlation analysis of supraclavicular PDFF to CIT was
      performed for the whole cohort and subgroups, sorted by body mass index (BMI) and
      body fat percentage. Results: Median age of participants (61.5% female) was 27
      years. BMI ranged from 19.0 to 38.5 kg/m(2), with body fat percentages from 4.6% 
      to 45.3%. Median supraclavicular PDFF of 82.5% and median gluteal PDFF of 91.1%, 
      were significantly different (P<0.0001). Median delta PDFF was 8.8% (3.9-21.9%). 
      Mean CIT was 4.7%+/-9.0%. No statistically significant correlation of
      supraclavicular PDFF and CIT was found in the whole cohort and in most of the
      observed subgroups. Just the subgroup with normal body fat percentage revealed
      significant correlations between supraclavicular PDFF and CIT (rho =-0.59;
      P=0.003). Delta PDFF was significantly associated with CIT (rho =0.36; P=0.026). 
      Conclusions: PDFF is influenced by adiposity. Therefore, if supraclavicular PDFF 
      is used as approach to indirectly assess BAT presence, body composition should be
      considered. Delta PDFF, as the difference between gluteal and supraclavicular
      PDFF, may be a marker of CIT.

TI  - Optimal scheduling of integrated energy system based on improved grey wolf
      optimization algorithm.
PG  - 7095
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-10958-7 [doi]
AB  - The optimal scheduling problem of integrated energy system (IES) has the
      characteristics of high-dimensional nonlinearity. Using the traditional Grey Wolf
      Optimizer (GWO) to solve the problem, it is easy to fall into a local optimum in 
      the process of optimization, resulting in a low-quality scheduling scheme. Aiming
      at the dispatchability of electric and heat loads, this paper proposes an
      electric and heat comprehensive demand response model considering the
      participation of dispatchers. On the basis of incentive demand response, the
      group aggregation model of electrical load is constructed, and the electric load 
      response model is constructed with the goal of minimizing the deviation between
      the dispatch signal and the load group aggregation characteristic model. Then, a 
      heat load scheduling model is constructed according to the ambiguity of the human
      body's perception of temperature. On the basis of traditional GWO, the Fuzzy
      C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is used to group wolves, which increases the
      diversity of the population, uses the Harris Hawk Optimizer (HHO) to design the
      prey to search for the best escape position, and reduces the local The optimal
      probability, and the use of Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) and Bat Optimizer (BO)
      to design the moving modes of different positions, increase the ability to find
      the global optimum, so as to obtain an Improved Gray Wolf Optimizer (IGWO), and
      then efficiently solve the model. IGWO can improve the defect of insufficient
      population diversity in the later stage of evolution, so that the population
      diversity can be better maintained during the entire evolution process. While
      taking into account the speed of optimization, it improves the algorithm's
      ability to jump out of the local optimum and realizes continuous deep search.
      Compared with the traditional intelligent Optimizer, IGWO has obvious improvement
      and achieved better results. At the same time, the comprehensive demand response 
      that considers the dispatcher's desired signal improves the accommodation of new 
      energy and reduces the operating cost of the system, and promotes the benign
      interaction between the source and the load.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria generate heat via uncoupled respiration
      due to excessive proton leak through uncoupling proteins (UCPs). We previously
      found hyperthermia in a newborn mouse model of fragile X syndrome and excessive
      leak in Fmr1 KO forebrain mitochondria caused by CoQ deficiency. The inefficient 
      thermogenic nature of Fmr1 mutant forebrain mitochondria was reminiscent of BAT
      metabolic features. Thus, we aimed to characterize BAT mitochondrial function in 
      these hyperthermic mice using a top-down approach. Although there was no change
      in steady-state levels of UCP1 expression between strains, BAT weighed
      significantly less in Fmr1 mutants compared with controls. Fmr1 KO BAT
      mitochondria demonstrated impaired substrate oxidation, lower mitochondrial
      membrane potentials and rates of respiration, and CoQ deficiency. The CoQ analog 
      decylubiquinone normalized CoQ-dependent electron flux and unmasked excessive
      proton leak. Unlike mutant forebrain, where such deficiency resulted in
      pathological proton leak, CoQ deficiency within BAT mitochondria resulted largely
      in abnormal substrate oxidation. This suggests that CoQ is important in BAT for
      uncoupled respiration to produce heat during development. Although our data
      provide further evidence of a link between fragile X mental retardation protein
      (FMRP) and CoQ biosynthesis, the results highlight the importance of CoQ in
      developing tissues and suggest tissue-specific differences from CoQ deficiency.
      Because BAT mitochondria are primarily responsible for regulating core body
      temperature, the defects we describe in Fmr1 KOs could manifest as an adaptive
      downregulated response to hyperthermia or could result from FMRP deficiency
      directly.

TI  - Endothelial Prohibitin Mediates Bidirectional Long-Chain Fatty Acid Transport in 
      White and Brown Adipose Tissues.
PG  - 1400-1409
LID - 10.2337/db21-0972 [doi]
AB  - The function of prohibitin-1 (PHB1) in adipocyte mitochondrial respiration,
      adaptive thermogenesis, and long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) metabolism has been
      reported. While intracellular PHB1 expression is ubiquitous, cell surface PHB1
      localization is selective for adipocytes and endothelial cells of adipose tissue.
      The importance of PHB1 in adipose endothelium has not been investigated, and its 
      vascular cell surface function has remained unclear. Here, we generated and
      analyzed mice with PHB1 knock-out specifically in endothelial cells (PHB1 EC-KO).
      Despite the lack of endothelial PHB1, mice developed normally and had normal
      vascularization in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue (BAT).
      Tumor and ex vivo explant angiogenesis assays also have not detected a functional
      defect in PHB1 KO endothelium. No metabolic phenotype was observed in PHB1 EC-KO 
      mice raised on a regular diet. We show that both male and female PHB1 EC-KO mice 
      have normal body composition and adaptive thermogenesis. However, PHB1 EC-KO mice
      displayed higher insulin sensitivity and increased glucose clearance when fed a
      high-fat diet. We demonstrate that the efficacy of LCFA deposition by adipocytes 
      is decreased by PHB1 EC-KO, in particular in BAT. Consistent with that, EC-KO
      mice have a defect in clearing triglycerides from systemic circulation. Free
      fatty acid release upon lipolysis induction was also found to be reduced in PHB1 
      EC-KO mice. Our results demonstrate that PHB1 in endothelial cells regulates
      bidirectional LCFA transport and thereby suppresses glucose utilization.

TI  - Is thermogenesis really needed for brown adipose tissue-mediated metabolic
      benefit?
LID - 10.1172/JCI159296 [doi]
LID - e159296 [pii]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat and functions as
      a metabolic sink for lipids, glucose, and branched-chain amino acids. Enhanced
      BAT thermogenesis is thought to tightly couple with beneficial energy metabolism.
      However, in this issue of the JCI, Huang et al. report a mouse model in which BAT
      thermogenesis was impaired, yet systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis were
      improved, on a high-fat diet compared with what occurred in control mice. The
      authors showed that BAT-specific deletion of mitochondrial thioredoxin-2 (TRX2)
      impaired adaptive thermogenesis through elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) and cytosolic efflux of mitochondrial DNA. On the other hand, TRX2 
      loss enhanced lipid uptake in the BAT and protected mice from obesity,
      hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. This study provides a unique model 
      in which BAT does not require thermogenesis per se to function as a lipid sink
      that leads to metabolic benefits in vivo.

TI  - Comparative staining of Rhinolophus spp. white blood cells in blood smears.
PG  - 750-756
LID - 10.14202/vetworld.2022.750-756 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: A drawback of studies on bat blood smears in the field is the
      lack of time for fixation because blood sampling using a non-lethal method often 
      provides less time for fixation in smear preparations due to the small volume of 
      blood collected. Usually, there is insufficient blood for another smear
      preparation, so it is necessary to use blood smears as rationally as possible,
      especially for rare bats. Many stains are used for staining peripheral blood
      smears, and they have advantages and disadvantages. This study aimed to examine
      commonly used stains for blood smears to select the best stain for staining
      peripheral blood smears in bats. Materials and Methods: In this study, 48 blood
      smears of Rhinolophus spp. bats were examined using several blood staining
      methods. Four methods that showed the best results were used in further
      experiments: Romanowsky-Giemsa, Pappenheim, hematoxylin-eosin, and eosin
      methylene blue. Results: Comparative analysis of different methods for staining
      bat blood smears revealed that the most convenient method for analyzing blood
      cells is Pappenheim method. Conclusion: Staining blood smears using Pappenheim
      method yield the least number of unsuccessful blood smear stains and are quite
      effective for the morphological analysis of blood cells.

PG  - coac027

AB  - Bat box microclimates vary spatially and temporally in temperature suitability.
      This heterogeneity subjects roosting bats to a variety of thermoregulatory
      challenges (e.g. heat and cold stress). Understanding how different bat box
      designs, landscape placements, weather and bat use affect temperature suitability
      and energy expenditure is critical to promote safe and beneficial artificial
      roosting habitat for species of conservation concern. From April to September
      2019, we systematically deployed 480 temperature dataloggers among 40 rocket box 
      style bat boxes of 5 designs and regularly monitored bat abundance. We used
      bioenergetic models to assess energy costs for endothermic and heterothermic bats
      and modelled the overheating risk for each box as a function of design,
      placement, bat abundance and weather. For endothermic bats, predicted daily
      energy expenditure was lower for solar-exposed placements, large group sizes and 
      a box design with enhanced thermal mass. For heterothermic bats, shaded landscape
      placements were the most energetically beneficial and bat box design was not
      important, because all designs generally offered microclimates suitable for
      torpor use at some position within the box. Overheating risk was highest for
      solar-exposed landscape placements and for designs lacking modifications to
      buffer temperature, and with increasing bat abundance, increasing ambient
      temperature and slower wind speeds. The external water jacket design, with the
      greatest thermal mass, concomitantly decreased overheating risk and endothermic
      energy expenditure. By assessing bat box suitability from two physiological
      perspectives, we provide a robust method to assess the conservation value of bat 
      box design and placement strategies. We recommend future studies examine how
      changing thermal mass and conductance can be used to diminish overheating risk
      while also enhancing the effects of social thermoregulation for bat box users.

TI  - Serological evidence of a pararubulavirus and a betacoronavirus in the
      geographically isolated Christmas Island flying-fox (Pteropus natalis).
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14579 [doi]
AB  - Due to their geographical isolation and small populations, insular bats may not
      be able to maintain acute immunizing viruses that rely on a large population for 
      viral maintenance. Instead, endemic transmission may rely on viruses establishing
      persistent infections within hosts or inducing only short-lived neutralizing
      immunity. Therefore, studies on insular populations are valuable for developing
      broader understanding of viral maintenance in bats. The Christmas Island
      flying-fox (CIFF; Pteropus natalis) is endemic on Christmas Island, a remote
      Australian territory, and is an ideal model species to understand viral
      maintenance in small, geographically isolated bat populations. Serum or plasma (n
      = 190), oral swabs (n = 199), faeces (n = 31), urine (n = 32) and urine swabs (n 
      = 25) were collected from 228 CIFFs. Samples were tested using multiplex
      serological and molecular assays, and attempts at virus isolation to determine
      the presence of paramyxoviruses, betacoronaviruses and Australian bat lyssavirus.
      Analysis of serological data provides evidence that the species is maintaining a 
      pararubulavirus and a betacoronavirus. There was little serological evidence
      supporting the presence of active circulation of the other viruses assessed in
      the present study. No viral nucleic acid was detected and no viruses were
      isolated. Age-seropositivity results support the hypothesis that geographically
      isolated bat populations can maintain some paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
      Further studies are required to elucidate infection dynamics and characterize
      viruses in the CIFF. Lastly, apparent absence of some pathogens could have
      implications for the conservation of the CIFF if a novel disease were introduced 
      into the population through human carriage or an invasive species. Adopting
      increased biosecurity protocols for ships porting on Christmas Island and for
      researchers and bat carers working with flying-foxes are recommended to decrease 
      the risk of pathogen introduction and contribute to the health and conservation
      of the species.

      recorded in Altai republic is particularly interesting (Myodopsylla trisellis -
      Myotis blythii). Further investigation is required to study vector role of bat
      fleas and the effects of flea parasitism on their natural hosts.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is often considered as a sink for nutrients to
      generate heat. However, when the complex hormonal and nervous inputs and
      intracellular signaling networks regulating substrate utilization are considered,
      BAT appears much more as a tightly controlled rheostat, regulating body
      temperature and balancing circulating nutrient levels. Here we provide an
      overview of key regulatory circuits, including the diurnal rhythm, determining
      glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid utilization and the interdependency of these 
      nutrients in thermogenesis. Moreover, we discuss additional factors mediating
      sympathetic BAT activation beyond beta-adrenergic signaling and the limitations
      of glucose-based BAT activity measurements to foster a better understanding and
      interpretation of BAT activity data.

TI  - Plasmalogen Inhibits Body Weight Gain by Activating Brown Adipose Tissue and
      Improving White Adipose Tissue Metabolism.
PG  - 140-147
LID - 10.3177/jnsv.68.140 [doi]
AB  - Plasmalogen, a phospholipid, exhibits preventive and therapeutic effects on
      dementia. Phospholipids improve fat metabolism, but it is unknown whether
      plasmalogen has an effect on fat metabolism. In this study, the effects of
      plasmalogen were determined by administering plasmalogen to KK-Ay mice. As a
      result, weight gain was significantly suppressed in the plasmalogen-treated group
      compared with the control group from 7 wk after the start of administration. In
      addition, plasmalogen administration increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)
      expression in brown adipose tissue. The effect is thought to result from liver
      kinase B1 (LKB1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/PR domain containing 16
      (PRDM16)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha
      (PGC-1alpha) pathway activation via adrenergic beta3 receptors. Furthermore, the 
      expression of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) gene associated with
      thermogenic factors and beta-oxidation was increased. We investigated the
      browning of white adipose tissue, but no increase in UCP1 gene expression was
      observed in perirenal adipose tissue, epididymis adipose tissue, mesenteric
      adipose tissue and inguinal region white adipose tissue. In contrast, plasmalogen
      increased the activity of AMPK, which is a central enzyme in lipid metabolism, in
      perirenal adipose tissue. Furthermore, the activity of the protein kinase A
      (PKA)/LKB1/AMPK/acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1
      (SCD-1), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) pathways was confirmed. Plasmalogen
      may inhibit weight gain by activating brown fat to increase heat production,
      inhibiting lipid synthesis, and promoting lipolysis in white fat.

TI  - [Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 Impacts on Metabolism in Muscle and Adipocytes].
PG  - 449-456
LID - 10.1248/yakushi.21-00176-1 [doi]
AB  - Prolyl isomerase Pin1 is associated with various substrates and controls their
      functions through the isomerization of proline. Interestingly, a high fat diet
      increases Pin1 levels in adipose tissues. Accordingly, we investigated how Pin1
      regulates energy metabolism in adipose tissues. Currently, adipocytes are divided
      into three types with distinct features. White adipocytes (WATs) store energy as 
      triglycerides under fed conditions and release non-esterified fatty acids and
      glycerol through lipolysis while fasting. Brown and beige adipocytes, which exist
      in subcutaneous fat (scWAT), promote energy consumption through thermogenesis. We
      found that Pin1 impacts both thermogenesis and lipolysis upon interaction with
      distinct substrates. When mice were exposed to cold stress, both brown adipose
      tissues (BAT) and scWAT from adipocyte-specific Pin1 knockout (KO) mice showed
      higher expression levels of thermogenic genes in comparison to those from
      wild-type mice. Furthermore, we observed that Pin1 binds to the PRDM16
      transcriptional cofactor, a major contributor to thermogenic programs, and
      promotes its degradation. Therefore, Pin1 suppresses thermogenesis. Meanwhile, in
      white adipocytes, Pin1 is involved in lipolysis. Pin1 deficiency enhanced
      lipolysis activity in epididymal WAT (epiWAT), but not in scWAT and BAT. In
      epiWAT, Pin1 interacts with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) which is a
      rate-limiting enzyme for lipolysis, and downregulates ATGL levels. Finally,
      adipocyte-specific Pin1 KO mice have less body weight and better glucose
      metabolism under high fat diet conditions. These observations indicate that Pin1 
      is involved in the function of adipocytes through its association with PRDM16 and
      ATGL. Pin1 inhibitors could have therapeutic applications in the treatment of
      obesity.

TI  - A randomised study to assess the nicotine pharmacokinetics of an oral nicotine
      pouch and two nicotine replacement therapy products.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-10544-x [doi]
AB  - Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) are intended for short-term use to help
      cigarette smokers to quit. Some smokers find NRTs ineffective or seek a more
      satisfactory source of nicotine. Tobacco-free oral nicotine pouch (NP) products
      have emerged as a potential reduced risk product compared with cigarettes and
      other tobacco products. In a randomised crossover clinical study, thirty-four
      healthy adult smokers were enrolled and their nicotine Cmax and AUC0-T determined
      for three 4 mg nicotine products (NP, gum, lozenge) under fasting conditions. The
      NP, lozenge and gum mean Cmax values were 8.5, 8.3 and 4.4 ng/mL, AUC0-T values
      were 30.6, 31.5 and 14.3 ng*h/mL, respectively. The NP showed similar nicotine
      bioavailability to the lozenge (p = 0.6526 (Cmax), p = 1.0000 (AUC0-T)), and
      superior bioavailability to the gum (p < 0.0001 for Cmax and AUC0-T). Compared
      with the lozenge, the NP demonstrated greater product satisfaction with a higher 
      number of positive responses to subjective satisfaction questions. All products
      were judged to be well-tolerated; the incidence of minor adverse events was lower
      for the NP (18.2%) than the lozenge (33.3%) or gum (18.8%). In summary, NPs may
      provide smokers with a more satisfying alternative nicotine source as compared to
      the reference NRTs.Study Registry/Registered Trial No: ISRCTN/ISRCTN65708311.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has emerged as an appealing therapeutic target for
      cardio metabolic diseases. BAT is a heat-producing organ and upon activation
      substantially lowers hyperlipidemia. In response to cold exposure, not only the
      uptake of lipids into BAT is increased but also the Cyp7b1-mediated synthesis of 
      bile acids (BA) from cholesterol in the liver is triggered. In addition to their 
      role for intestinal lipid digestion, BA act as endocrine signals that can
      activate thermogenesis in BAT. When exposed to cold temperatures, Cyp7b1 (-/-)
      mice have compromised BAT function along with reduced fecal bile acid levels.
      Here, we aim to evaluate the role of Cyp7b1 for BAT-dependent lipid clearance.
      Using metabolic studies with radioactive tracers, we show that in response to a
      cold stimulus, BAT-mediated clearance of fatty acids derived from
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), and their remnants are reduced in Cyp7b1
      (-/-) mice. The impaired lipid uptake can be explained by reduced BAT lipoprotein
      lipase (LPL) levels and compromised organ activity in Cyp7b1 (-/-) mice, which
      may be linked to impaired insulin signaling. Overall, our findings reveal that
      alterations of systemic lipoprotein metabolism mediated by cold-activated BAT are
      dependent, at least in part, on CYP7Beta1.

AB  - Zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses poses an ongoing threat to human
      populations. Endemic outbreaks of swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus
      (SADS-CoV) have caused severe economic losses in the pig industry and have the
      potential to cause human outbreaks. Currently, there are no vaccines or specific 
      antivirals against SADS-CoV, and our limited understanding of SADS-CoV host entry
      factors could hinder prompt responses to a potential human outbreak. Using a
      genomewide CRISPR knockout screen, we identified placenta-associated 8 protein
      (PLAC8) as an essential host factor for SADS-CoV infection. Knockout of PLAC8
      abolished SADS-CoV infection, which was restored by complementing PLAC8 from
      multiple species, including human, rhesus macaques, mouse, pig, pangolin, and
      bat, suggesting a conserved infection pathway and susceptibility of SADS-CoV
      among mammals. Mechanistically, PLAC8 knockout does not affect viral entry;
      rather, knockout cells displayed a delay and reduction in viral subgenomic RNA
      expression. In a swine primary intestinal epithelial culture (IEC) infection
      model, differentiated cultures have high levels of PLAC8 expression and support
      SADS-CoV replication. In contrast, expanding IECs have low levels of PLAC8
      expression and are resistant to SADS-CoV infection. PLAC8 expression patterns
      translate in vivo; the immunohistochemistry of swine ileal tissue revealed high
      levels of PLAC8 protein in neonatal compared to adult tissue, mirroring the known
      SADS-CoV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets. Overall, PLAC8 is an essential factor 
      for SADS-CoV infection and may serve as a promising target for antiviral
      development for potential pandemic SADS-CoV.

PG  - 250-263

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 have demonstrated
      remarkable efficacy in the treatment of B cell malignancies. Current CAR T cell
      manufacturing protocols are complex and costly due to their reliance on viral
      vectors. Non-viral systems of genetic modification, such as with transposase and 
      transposon systems, offer a potential streamlined alternative for CAR T cell
      manufacture and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. In this study, 
      we utilized the previously described transposase from the little brown bat,
      designated piggyBat, for production of CD19-specific CAR T cells. PiggyBat
      demonstrates efficient CAR transgene delivery, with a relatively low variability 
      in integration copy number across a range of manufacturing conditions as well as 
      a similar integration site profile to super-piggyBac transposon and viral
      vectors. PiggyBat-generated CAR T cells demonstrate CD19-specific cytotoxic
      efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These data demonstrate that alternative, naturally
      occurring DNA transposons can be efficiently re-tooled to be exploited in
      real-world applications.

TI  - Mammal extinction facilitated biome shift and human population change during the 
      last glacial termination in East-Central Europe.

AB  - The study of local extinction times, together with the associated environmental
      and human population changes in the last glacial termination, provides insights
      into the causes of mega- and microfauna extinctions. In East-Central (EC) Europe,
      groups of Palaeolithic humans were present throughout the last glacial maximum,
      but disappeared suddenly around 15,200 cal BP. In this study cave sediment
      profiles dated using radiocarbon techniques and a large set of mammal bones dated
      directly by AMS (14)C were used to determine local extinction times. These were, 
      in turn, compared to changes in the total megafauna population of EC Europe
      derived from coprophilous fungi, the Epigravettian population decline,
      quantitative climate models, pollen and plant macrofossil inferred climate, as
      well as to biome reconstructions. The results suggest that the population size of
      large herbivores decreased in the area after 17,700 cal BP, when temperate tree
      abundance and warm continental steppe cover both increased in the lowlands.
      Boreal forest expansion started around 16,200 cal BP. Cave sediments show the
      decline of narrow-headed vole and arctic lemming populations specifically
      associated with a tundra environment at the same time and the expansion of the
      common vole, an inhabitant of steppes. The last dated appearance of arctic
      lemming was at ~ 16,640 cal BP, while that of the narrow-headed vole at ~ 13,340,
      and the estimated extinction time of woolly mammoth was either at 13,830 (GRIWM) 
      or 15,210 (PHASE), and reindeer at 11,860 (GRIWM) or 12,550 cal BP (PHASE). The
      population decline of the large herbivore fauna slightly preceded changes in
      terrestrial vegetation, and likely facilitated it via a reduction in the
      intensity of grazing and the concomitant accumulation of plant biomass.
      Furthermore, it is possible to conclude that the Late Epigravettian population
      had high degree of quarry-fidelity; they left the basin when these mammals
      vanished.

AB  - The spontaneous formation of biological substances, such as human organs, are
      governed by different stimuli driven by complex 3D self-organization protocols at
      the molecular level. The fundamentals of such molecular self-assembly processes
      are critical for fabrication of advanced technological components in nature. We
      propose and experimentally demonstrate a promising 3D printing method with
      self-healing property based on molecular self-assembly-monolayer principles,
      which is conceptually different than the existing 3D printing protocols. The
      proposed molecular building-block approach uses metal ion-mediated continuous
      self-assembly of organic molecular at liquid-liquid interfaces to create 2D and
      3D structures. Using this technique, we directly printed nanosheets and 3D rods
      using dithiol molecules as building block units.

TI  - Why bears hibernate? Redefining the scaling energetics of hibernation.
PG  - 20220456
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.0456 [doi]
AB  - Hibernation is a natural state of suspended animation that many mammals
      experience and has been interpreted as an adaptive strategy for saving energy.
      However, the actual amount of savings that hibernation represents, and
      particularly its dependence on body mass (the 'scaling') has not been calculated 
      properly. Here, we estimated the scaling of daily energy expenditure of
      hibernation (DEEH), covering a range of five orders of magnitude in mass. We
      found that DEEH scales isometrically with mass, which means that a gram of
      hibernating bat has a similar metabolism to that of a gram of bear, 20 000 times 
      larger. Given that metabolic rate of active animals scales allometrically, the
      point where these scaling curves intersect with DEEH represents the mass where
      energy savings by hibernation are zero. For BMR, these zero savings are attained 
      for a relatively small bear (approx. 75 kg). Calculated on a per cell basis, the 
      cellular metabolic power of hibernation was estimated to be 1.3 x 10(-12) +/- 2.6
      x 10(-13) W cell(-1), which is lower than the minimum metabolism of isolated
      mammalian cells. This supports the idea of the existence of a minimum metabolism 
      that permits cells to survive under a combination of cold and hypoxia.

TI  - Nanovectorization of Ivermectin to avoid overdose of drugs.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/07391102.2022.2066020 [doi]
AB  - Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug that results in the death of the targeted
      parasites using several mechanical actions. While very well supported, it can
      induce in rare cases, adverse effects including coma and respiratory failure in
      case of overdose. This problem should be solved especially in an emergency
      situation. For instance, the first pandemic of the 21th century was officially
      declared in early 2020, and while several vaccines around the worlds have been
      used, an effective treatment against this new strain of coronavirus, better known
      as SARS-CoV-2, should also be considered, especially given the massive appearance
      of variants. From all the tested therapies, Ivermectin showed a potential
      reduction of the viral portability, but sparked significant debate around the
      dose needed to achieve these positive results. To answer this general question,
      we propose, using simulations, to show that the nanovectorization of Ivermectin
      on BN oxide nanosheets can increase the transfer of the drug to its target and
      thus decrease the quantity of drug necessary to cope with the disease. This first
      application could help science to develop such nanocargo to avoid adverse
      effects.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

TI  - Loss of UCP1 function augments recruitment of futile lipid cycling for
      thermogenesis in murine brown fat.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Classical ATP-independent non-shivering thermogenesis enabled by
      uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is activated, but not
      essential for survival, in the cold. It has long been suspected that futile
      ATP-consuming substrate cycles also contribute to thermogenesis and can partially
      compensate for the genetic ablation of UCP1 in mouse models. Futile ATP-dependent
      thermogenesis could thereby enable survival in the cold even when brown fat is
      less abundant or missing. METHODS: In this study, we explore different potential 
      sources of UCP1-independent thermogenesis and identify a futile ATP-consuming
      triglyceride/fatty acid cycle as the main contributor to cellular heat production
      in brown adipocytes lacking UCP1. We uncover the mechanism on a molecular level
      and pinpoint the key enzymes involved using pharmacological and genetic
      interference. RESULTS: ATGL is the most important lipase in terms of releasing
      fatty acids from lipid droplets, while DGAT1 accounts for the majority of fatty
      acid re-esterification in UCP1-ablated brown adipocytes. Furthermore, we
      demonstrate that chronic cold exposure causes a pronounced remodeling of adipose 
      tissues and leads to the recruitment of lipid cycling capacity specifically in
      BAT of UCP1-knockout mice, possibly fueled by fatty acids from white fat.
      Quantification of triglyceride/fatty acid cycling clearly shows that UCP1-ablated
      animals significantly increase turnover rates at room temperature and below.
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an important role for futile lipid cycling in
      adaptive thermogenesis and total energy expenditure.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine barriers and adherence to topical glaucoma medication in a
      pediatric glaucoma population in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional
      study was undertaken at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi
      Arabia during 2016-2017. Parents (father or mother) of children aged 6 months to 
      15 years with a history of glaucoma were interviewed. Rasch analysis was
      performed to assess the psychometric properties of the developed 12-item
      barriers-to-adherence tool (BAT-12) and to identify barriers deemed highly
      important. The 12-items were adapted from previous studies examining different
      barriers to adherence in different populations. Medication adherence was assessed
      by asking parents a series of closed-ended questions about the frequency of
      missed medications. Determinants of missed medications on at least 1 out of the
      last 3 days were examined using Poisson regression. RESULTS: One hundred and six 
      parents were interviewed. The 12-item scale had acceptable psychometric
      properties. Barriers deemed important were forgetfulness (logit -0.59), complex
      dosing regimen (logit 0.09), and being too busy with other work/activities (logit
      0.14). When asked how often, on average, their child missed the prescribed
      medication, 26 (24.5%) reported daily, 17(16.0%) reported few times per week, and
      32 (30.2%) reported once per week. A third of parents (n = 37, 34.9%) reported
      having missed giving all drops on at least one day in the last 3 days. Poisson
      regression with robust variance revealed that increase in age of the child
      (prevalence ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.03-1.14]; p = 0.003) and increase in parents' 
      barriers score (prevalence ratio, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.49, 3.03]; p < 0.001) were
      significantly associated with having missed medications on at least one out of
      the last three days while adjusting for the effect of father's current employment
      status and area of residence. CONCLUSIONS: The tool we used to examine barriers
      to glaucoma medication had acceptable psychometric properties and could be used
      and strengthened in future studies. Our study highlights poor adherence to
      glaucoma medications among children with glaucoma.

TI  - Pteropine Orthoreovirus, PRV7S (Sikamat Virus) Demonstrates Oncolysis in
      Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cell Lines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncolytic properties had been demonstrated in Mammalian Orthoreovirus
      (MRV) and Avian Orthorevirus (ARV). Besides MRV and ARV, Pteropine Orthoreovirus 
      (PRV) is also categorized under the genus Orthoreovirus. PRV7S (Sikamat virus) is
      an orthoreovirus isolated in Malaysia. Present study aims to investigate the
      oncolytic effects of PRV7S on ranges of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells
      through apoptosis in comparison to MRV3. METHODS: Non-cancerous nasopharyngeal
      (NCNP) and NPC cells were infected by PRV7S and MRV3. The effects of PRV7S on the
      proliferation inhibition and apoptotic activity of NPC cells was examined using
      MTT assay and flow cytometry. Additionally, western blot assay was performed to
      analyze the expression of RAS and apoptotic protein. Lastly, qPCR assay was
      performed to demonstrate that PRV7S and MRV3 replicated in infected-NPC and
      infected-NCNP cells. RESULTS: The proliferation of NPC cells were significantly
      inhibited after PRV7S infection in a time dependent manner in comparison to
      infected-NCPC cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that PRV7S infection was able
      to induce apoptosis on NPC cells at 48 hpi. Western blot results showed that upon
      PRV7S infection, N/H/K RAS protein expression was reduced, whereas caspase-3
      protein expression increased in NPC cells. qPCR assay showed higher viral load of
      PRV7S found in infected-NPC compared to infected-NCNP cells. CONCLUSIONS: PRV7S
      inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of NPC cells similar to MRV3.
      Therefore, PRV7S is a potential oncolytic virus.

TI  - Epidemiology and Genomic Characterization of Two Novel SARS-Related Coronaviruses
      in Horseshoe Bats from Guangdong, China.
PG  - e0046322
LID - 10.1128/mbio.00463-22 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2,
      the causative agents of SARS, which broke out in 2003, and coronavirus disease
      2019 (COVID-2019), which broke out in 2019, probably originated in Rhinolophus
      sinicus and R. affinis, respectively. Rhinolophus bats are important hosts for
      coronaviruses. Many SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been detected in
      bats from different areas of China; however, the diversity of bat SARSr-CoVs is
      increasing, and their transmission mechanisms have attracted much attention.
      Here, we report the findings of SARSr-CoVs in R. sinicus and R. affinis from
      South China from 2008 to 2021. The full-length genome sequences of the two novel 
      SARSr-CoVs obtained from Guangdong shared 83 to 88% and 71 to 72% nucleotide
      identities with human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, while sharing high
      similarity with human SARS-CoV in hypervariable open reading frame 8 (ORF8).
      Significant recombination occurred between the two novel SARSr-CoVs. Phylogenetic
      analysis showed that the two novel bat SARSr-CoVs from Guangdong were more
      distant than the bat SARSr-CoVs from Yunnan to human SARS-CoV. We found that
      transmission in bats contributes more to virus diversity than time. Although our 
      results of the sequence analysis of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and the
      expression pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) inferred that these 
      viruses could not directly infect humans, risks still exist after some
      unpredictable mutations. Thus, this study increased our understanding of the
      genetic diversity and transmission of SARSr-CoVs carried by bats in the field.
      IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and
      SARS-CoV-2 probably originated from the SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs)
      carried by Rhinolophus bats from Yunnan, China. Systematic investigations of the 
      reservoir hosts carrying SARSr-CoVs in Guangdong and the reservoir distribution
      and transmission are urgently needed to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we
      detected SARSr-CoV in Rhinolophus bat samples from Guangdong in 2009 and 2021 and
      found that the transmission of SARSr-CoV from different host populations
      contributes more to increased virus diversity than time. Bat SARSr-CoVs in
      Guangdong had genetic diversity, and Guangdong was also the hot spot for
      SARSr-CoVs. We once again prove that R. sinicus plays an important role in the
      maintenance of the SARS-CoVs. Besides, the SARSr-CoVs are mainly transmitted
      through the intestines in bats, and these SARSr-CoVs found in Guangdong could not
      use human ACE2 (hACE2), but whether they can pass through intermediate hosts or
      directly infect humans requires further research. Our findings demonstrate the
      ability of SARSr-CoVs to spread across species.

AB  - Botulism antitoxin heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G - Equine; BAT) product is
      a sterile solution of F(ab')2 and F(ab')2 -related antibody fragments prepared
      from plasma obtained from horses that have been immunized with a specific
      serotype of botulinum toxoid and toxin. BAT product is indicated for the
      treatment of symptomatic botulism following documented or suspected exposure to
      botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A to G in adults and pediatric patients.
      Pharmacokinetic and exposure-response models were used to explore the
      relationship between BAT product exposure and the probability of survival, and
      the occurrence of relevant moderate clinical signs observed during the
      preclinical development of BAT product to justify the clinical dose. The
      predicted probability of survival in humans for all serotypes of botulinum
      neurotoxin was more than 95.9% following intravenous administration of one vial
      of BAT product. Furthermore, this BAT product dose is expected to result in
      significant protection against clinical signs in human adults for all botulinum
      neurotoxin serotypes. Our exposure response model indicates that we have
      sufficient antitoxin levels to give full protection at various theoretical
      exposure levels and, based on neutralization capacity/potency of one dose of BAT 
      product, it is expected to exceed the amount of circulating botulinum neurotoxin.

TI  - Adipose tissue-specific ablation of PGC-1beta impairs thermogenesis in brown fat.
LID - dmm049223 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/dmm.049223 [doi]
AB  - Impaired thermogenesis observed in mice with whole-body ablation of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1beta (PGC-1beta; officially
      known as PPARGC1B) may result from impaired brown fat (brown adipose tissue; BAT)
      function, but other mechanism(s) could be involved. Here, using adipose-specific 
      PGC-1beta knockout mice (PGC-1beta-AT-KO mice) we aimed to learn whether specific
      PGC-1beta ablation in adipocytes is sufficient to drive cold sensitivity. Indeed,
      we found that warm-adapted (30 degrees C) mutant mice were relatively sensitive
      to acute cold exposure (6 degrees C). When these mice were subjected to cold
      exposure for 7 days (7-day-CE), adrenergic stimulation of their metabolism was
      impaired, despite similar levels of thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 in BAT in
      PGC-1beta-AT-KO and wild-type mice. Gene expression in BAT of mutant mice
      suggested a compensatory increase in lipid metabolism to counteract the
      thermogenic defect. Interestingly, a reduced number of contacts between
      mitochondria and lipid droplets associated with low levels of L-form of optic
      atrophy 1 was found in BAT of PGC-1beta-AT-KO mice. These genotypic differences
      were observed in warm-adapted mutant mice, but they were partially masked by
      7-day-CE. Collectively, our results suggest a role for PGC-1beta in controlling
      BAT lipid metabolism and thermogenesis. This article has an associated First
      Person interview with the first author of the paper.

TI  - Renal adaptation in relation to insectivorous feeding habit in the greater
      mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae).
LID - 10.1002/ar.24946 [doi]
AB  - We examined the histological structure of the kidneys of Myotis myotis to better 
      understand their structural adaptations to dietary habits. M. myotis is an
      insectivorous bat species that belongs to the family Vespertilionidae. The
      kidneys of M. myotis are unilobular, bean-shaped, and surrounded by a renal
      capsule. The two parts are distinguished by a thin cortex and a thicker medulla. 
      Renal corpuscles consist of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule. The proximal
      tubule consists of cubic cells with a well-developed brush border, whereas the
      distal tubule is lined with a simple cubic epithelium without a brush border. The
      Henle's loop, located in the medullary region, was composed of flat cells. The
      microvilli of proximal tubule epithelial cells and basal lamina of proximal and
      distal tubule epithelial cells were periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive. The
      PAS-positive reaction of the microvilli of proximal tubular epithelial cells and 
      basal lamina of proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells is due to the
      presence of glycogen, which may be used as an energy substrate during absorption.
      The presence of acidic glycoconjugates in the papilla was demonstrated by Alcian 
      blue (pH 2.5)-PAS staining. According to the result of silver impregnation
      staining, it was determined that reticular fibers form a dense fibrillary network
      in the kidney parenchymal tissue. Reticular fibers are responsible for
      demarcating and supporting the borders of cells by forming a thin network of
      fibrils beneath the basal lamina of the cells. Structural features in the kidney,
      such as a thin cortex and thicker medulla, long conical papilla, and division of 
      the thick medulla into inner and outer regions, of M. myotis may be an adaptation
      to produce concentrated urine, thereby reducing water loss associated with
      insectivorous feeding habits.

AB  - Understanding the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) has been a highly debatable and unresolved issue for scientific
      communities all over the world. Understanding the mechanism of virus entry to the
      host cells is crucial to deciphering the susceptibility profiles of animal
      species to SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 ligands (receptor-binding
      domain on spike protein) with its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting
      enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a critical determinant of host range and cross-species
      transmission. In this study, we developed and implemented a rigorous
      computational approach for predicting binding affinity between 299 ACE2 orthologs
      from diverse vertebrate species and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The findings
      show that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can bind to a wide range of vertebrate
      species carrying evolutionary divergent ACE2, implying a broad host range at the 
      virus entry level, which may contribute to cross-species transmission and further
      viral evolution. Furthermore, the current study facilitated the identification of
      genetic determinants that may differentiate susceptible from resistant host
      species based on the conservation of ACE2-spike protein interacting residues in
      vertebrate host species known to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, these 
      genetic determinants warrant in vivo experimental confirmation. The molecular
      interactions associated with varied binding affinity of distinct ACE2 isoforms in
      a specific bat species were identified using protein structure analysis, implying
      the existence of diversified bat species' susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The
      current study's findings highlight the importance of intensive surveillance
      programmes aimed at identifying susceptible hosts, especially those with the
      potential to transmit zoonotic pathogens, in order to prevent future outbreaks.

TI  - Longitudinal Survey of Coronavirus Circulation and Diversity in Insectivorous Bat
      Colonies in Zimbabwe.
LID - 781 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have linked bats to outbreaks of viral diseases in human
      populations such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 
      METHODS: We carried out a longitudinal survey from August 2020 to July 2021 at
      two sites in Zimbabwe with bat-human interactions: Magweto cave and Chirundu
      farm. A total of 1732 and 1866 individual bat fecal samples were collected,
      respectively. Coronaviruses and bat species were amplified using PCR systems.
      RESULTS: Analysis of the coronavirus sequences revealed a high genetic diversity,
      and we identified different sub-viral groups in the Alphacoronavirus and
      Betacoronavirus genus. The established sub-viral groups fell within the described
      Alphacoronavirus sub-genera: Decacovirus, Duvinacovirus, Rhinacovirus,
      Setracovirus and Minunacovirus and for Betacoronavirus sub-genera:
      Sarbecoviruses, Merbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Our results showed an overall
      proportion for CoV positive PCR tests of 23.7% at Chirundu site and 16.5% and
      38.9% at Magweto site for insectivorous bats and Macronycteris gigas,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The higher risk of bat coronavirus exposure for humans
      was found in December to March in relation to higher viral shedding peaks of
      coronaviruses in the parturition, lactation and weaning months of the bat
      populations at both sites. We also highlight the need to further document viral
      infectious risk in human/domestic animal populations surrounding bat habitats in 
      Zimbabwe.

TI  - Gene Expression Profile Induced by Two Different Variants of Street Rabies Virus 
      in Mice.
LID - 692 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040692 [doi]
AB  - Pathogenicity and pathology of rabies virus (RABV) varies according to the
      variant, but the mechanisms are not completely known. In this study, gene
      expression profile in brains of mice experimentally infected with RABV isolated
      from a human case of dog rabies (V2) or vampire bat-acquired rabies (V3) were
      analyzed. In total, 138 array probes associated with 120 genes were expressed
      differentially between mice inoculated with V2 and sham-inoculated control mice
      at day 10 post-inoculation. A single probe corresponding to an unannotated gene
      was identified in V3 versus control mice. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed
      that all of the genes upregulated in mice inoculated with V2 RABV were involved
      in the biological process of immune defense against pathogens. Although both
      variants are considered pathogenic, inoculation by the same conditions generated 
      different gene expression results, which is likely due to differences in
      pathogenesis between the dog and bat RABV variants. This study demonstrated the
      global gene expression in experimental infection due to V3 wild-type RABV, from
      the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus, an important source of infection for humans,
      domestic animals and wildlife in Latin America.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23084228 [doi]
AB  - Zucker fatty diabetes mellitus (ZFDM) rats harboring the missense mutation (fa)
      in a leptin receptor gene have been recently established as a novel animal model 
      of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we explored changes in cardiovascular
      dynamics including blood pressure and heart rate (HR) associated with the
      progression of obesity and T2D, as well as pathological changes in adipose tissue
      and kidney. There was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
      in ZFDM-Lepr(fa/fa) (Homo) compared with ZFDM-Lepr(fa/+) (Hetero) rats, while HR 
      and plasma adrenaline in Homo were significantly lower than Hetero. The mRNA
      expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in perirenal white adipose tissue
      (WAT) from Homo was significantly higher than Hetero. Interscapular brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) in Homo was degenerated and whitened. The plasma blood urea nitrogen
      in Homo was significantly higher than Hetero. In summary, we demonstrated for the
      first time that HR and plasma adrenaline concentration but not SBP in Homo
      decrease with obesity and T2D. In addition, inflammation occurs in WAT from Homo,
      while whitening occurs in BAT. Further, renal function is impaired in Homo. In
      the future, ZFDM rats will be useful for investigating metabolic changes
      associated with the progression of obesity and T2D.

TI  - Pep19 Has a Positive Effect on Insulin Sensitivity and Ameliorates Both Hepatic
      and Adipose Tissue Phenotype of Diet-Induced Obese Mice.
LID - 4082 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23084082 [doi]
AB  - Peptide DIIADDEPLT (Pep19) has been previously suggested to improve metabolic
      parameters, without adverse central nervous system effects, in a murine model of 
      diet-induced obesity. Here, we aimed to further evaluate whether Pep19 oral
      administration has anti-obesogenic effects, in a well-established high-fat
      diet-induced obesity model. Male Swiss mice, fed either a standard diet (SD) or
      high-fat diet (HFD), were orally administrated for 30 consecutive days, once a
      day, with saline vehicle or Pep19 (1 mg/kg). Next, several metabolic,
      morphological, and behavioral parameters were evaluated. Oral administration of
      Pep19 attenuated HFD body-weight gain, reduced in approximately 40% the absolute 
      mass of the endocrine pancreas, and improved the relationship between circulating
      insulin and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Pep19 treatment of HFD-fed mice
      attenuated liver inflammation, hepatic fat distribution and accumulation, and
      lowered plasma alanine aminotransferase activity. The inguinal fat depot from the
      SD group treated with Pep19 showed multilocular brown-fat-like cells and
      increased mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), suggesting browning on 
      inguinal white adipose cells. Morphological analysis of brown adipose tissue
      (BAT) from HFD mice showed the presence of larger white-like unilocular cells,
      compared to BAT from SD, Pep19-treated SD or HFD mice. Pep19 treatment produced
      no alterations in mice behavior. Oral administration of Pep19 ameliorates some
      metabolic traits altered by diet-induced obesity in a Swiss mice model.

TI  - Paramyxovirus Diversity within One Population of Miniopterus fuliginosus Bats in 
      Sri Lanka.
LID - 434 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11040434 [doi]
AB  - Bats are known as typical reservoirs for a number of viruses, including viruses
      of the family Paramyxoviridae. Representatives of the subfamily
      Orthoparamyxovirinae are distributed worldwide and can cause mild to fatal
      diseases when infecting humans. The research on Paramyxoviruses (PMVs) from
      different bat hosts all over the world aims to understand the diversity,
      evolution and distribution of these viruses and to assess their zoonotic
      potential. A high number of yet unclassified PMVs from bats are recorded. In our 
      study, we investigated bat species from the families Rhinolophidae, Hipposiderae,
      Pteropodidae and Miniopteridae that are roosting sympatrically in the Wavul Galge
      cave (Koslanda, Sri Lanka). The sampling at three time points (March and July
      2018; January 2019) and screening for PMVs with a generic PCR show the presence
      of different novel PMVs in 10 urine samples collected from Miniopterus
      fuliginosus. Sequence analysis revealed a high similarity of the novel strains
      among each other and to other unclassified PMVs collected from Miniopterus bats. 
      In this study, we present the first detection of PMVs in Sri Lanka and the
      presence of PMVs in the bat species M. fuliginosus for the first time.

TI  - Rutaecarpine Promotes Adipose Thermogenesis and Protects against HFD-Induced
      Obesity via AMPK/PGC-1alpha Pathway.
LID - 469 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph15040469 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological activation of adaptive thermogenesis to increase energy
      expenditure is considered to be a novel strategy for obesity.
      Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1alpha
      (PGC-1alpha), which serves as an inducible co-activator in energy expenditure, is
      highly expressed in brown adipose tissues (BAT). In this study, we found a
      PGC-1alpha transcriptional activator, natural compound rutaecarpine (Rut), which 
      promoted brown adipocytes mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis in vitro.
      Chronic Rut treatment reduced the body weight gain and mitigated insulin
      sensitivity through brown and beige adipocyte thermogenesis. Mechanistic study
      showed that Rut activated the energy metabolic pathway AMP-activated protein
      kinase (AMPK)/PGC-1alpha axis, and deficiency of AMPK abolished the beneficial
      metabolic phenotype of the Rut treatment in vitro and in vivo. In summary, a
      PGC-1alpha transcriptional activator Rut was found to activate brown and beige
      adipose thermogenesis to resist diet-induced obesity through AMPK pathway. Our
      findings serve as a further understanding of the natural compound in adipose
      tissue and provides a possible strategy to combat obesity and related metabolic
      disorders.

TI  - Fast Phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 by Compression.
LID - 439 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24040439 [doi]
AB  - The compression method to assess similarity, in the sense of having a small
      normalized compression distance (NCD), was developed based on algorithmic
      information theory to quantify the similarity in files ranging from words and
      languages to genomes and music pieces. It has been validated on objects from
      different domains always using essentially the same software. We analyze the
      whole-genome phylogeny and taxonomy of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible
      for causing the COVID-19 disease, using the alignment-free compression method to 
      assess similarity. We compare the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a database of over 6500
      viruses. The results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is closest in that
      database to the RaTG13 virus and rather close to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses 
      bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45. Over 6500 viruses are identified (given by
      their registration code) with larger NCDs. The NCDs are compared with the NCDs
      between the mtDNA of familiar species. We address the question of whether
      pangolins are involved in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The compression method is simpler
      and possibly faster than any other whole-genome method, which makes it the ideal 
      tool to explore phylogeny. Here, we use it for the complex case of determining
      this similarity between the COVID-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2 and many other viruses.
      The resulting phylogeny and taxonomy closely resemble earlier results from by
      alignment-based methods and a machine-learning method, providing the most
      compelling evidence to date for the compression method, showing that one can
      achieve equivalent results both simply and quickly.

TI  - Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on the Course of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in
      Patients Treated with Biological Therapeutic Agents: A Case-Control Study.
LID - 843 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10040843 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has raised
      concerns in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), not only due to
      consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 itself but also as a possible cause of
      IBD relapse. The main objective of this study was to assess the role of
      SARS-CoV-2 in IBD clinical recurrence in a cohort of patients undergoing
      biological therapy. Second, we evaluated the difference in C-reactive protein
      (CRP) levels between the start and end of the follow-up period (DeltaCRP) and the
      rate of biological therapy discontinuation. Patients with IBD positive for
      SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with non-infected patients. IBD recurrence was
      defined as the need for intensification of current therapy. We enrolled 95 IBD
      patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 190 non-infected patients. During
      follow-up, 11 of 95 (11.6%) SARS-CoV-2-infected patients experienced disease
      recurrence compared to 21 of 190 (11.3%) in the control group (p = 0.894).
      Forty-six (48.4%) SARS-CoV-2-infected patients discontinued biological therapy
      versus seven (3.7%) in the control group (p &lt; 0.01). In the multivariate
      analysis, biological agent discontinuation (p = 0.033) and DeltaCRP (p = 0.017), 
      but not SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.298), were associated with IBD recurrence.
      SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with increased IBD recurrence rates in
      this cohort of patients treated with biological agents.

TI  - Social Media Interventions Strengthened COVID-19 Immunization Campaign.
PG  - 869893
LID - 10.3389/fped.2022.869893 [doi]
AB  - Background: Since The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has recommended the
      COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty in children aged 5-11, the immunization campaign faced
      vaccine hesitancy in parents. Social media are emerging as leading information
      source that could play a significant role to counteract vaccine hesitancy,
      influencing parents' opinions and perceptions. Our aim was to evaluate the
      coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty in a cohort of children aged 5-11
      whose families have been counseled to use Social Media to counteract vaccine
      hesitancy. Methods: All parents of children aged 5-11 in a primary care setting
      were instructed by their pediatrician to get accurate information about the
      COVID-19 vaccine from a Facebook page. Active calls to vaccinate children were
      also scheduled through messaging services Pediatotem and Whatsapp. Vaccination
      rates of children in the study were assessed with an electronic database and
      compared to both regional and national child vaccination rates. Results: Coverage
      of 277 children aged 5-11 was analyzed from 16 December 2021 to 31 January 2022. 
      A total of 62.4% (173/277) of enrolled children received the 1st dose of COVID-19
      vaccine Comirnaty and 39.7% (110/277) the 2nd dose. Coverage rates were higher
      compared both to the regional population (1st dose: 48.8%, 2nd dose: 24.6%; p =
      0.001) and national population (1st dose: 32.1%, 2nd dose: 13.8%; p < 0.001).
      Conclusion: Increasing vaccine confidence using Social Media interventions have a
      positive impact on vaccination acceptance of parents.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes, Risk Perception, Preparedness and Vaccine Intent of Health 
      Care Providers towards the Nipah Virus in South India.
LID - 56 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/tropicalmed7040056 [doi]
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) disease (NVD) remains a re-emerging public health threat in
      India. We assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception of NVD and
      future vaccine intent among a convenience sample of health care providers (HCP). 
      The primary outcome measures were the knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception
      scores. Of 261 participants surveyed, 203 (77.8%) had heard of NiV and associated
      symptoms. The majority (248, 95%) identified the fruit bat as a primary NiV
      reservoir and 205 (79.8%) were aware of human-to-human transmission via droplets.
      Only 101 (38.7%) participants were aware that drinking date palm sap is a risk
      factor for transmission. Most HCP either agreed (117 (44.8%)) or strongly agreed 
      (131 (50.2%)) that NiV is a serious illness. Less than half (121 (46.4%)) were
      aware of any institutional protocol for NiV; 235 (90.7%) of HCP stated that they 
      need more information about prevention and treatment options. Knowledge scores
      were significantly higher among physicians compared to nurses whereas nurses and 
      academic providers were more likely to have higher attitudes scores. A majority
      of respondents (20,779.9%) were willing to be vaccinated and willing to recommend
      the NiV vaccine to their patients (21,682.8%). Future strategies include
      education of HCP to bridge the knowledge gaps and enhance preparedness through
      disease-specific training for NiV infection.

TI  - Liver and White/Brown Fat Dystrophy Associates with Gut Microbiota and
      Metabolomic Alterations in 3xTg Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.
LID - 278 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12040278 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic impairments and liver and adipose depots alterations were reported in
      subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the role of the
      liver-adipose-tissue-brain axis in AD pathophysiology. The gut microbiota might
      play a modulating role. We investigated the alterations to the liver and
      white/brown adipose tissues (W/BAT) and their relationships with serum and gut
      metabolites and gut bacteria in a 3xTg mouse model during AD onset (adulthood)
      and progression (aging) and the impact of high-fat diet (HFD) and intranasal
      insulin (INI). Glucose metabolism ((18)FDG-PET), tissue radiodensity (CT), liver 
      and W/BAT histology, BAT-thermogenic markers were analyzed. 16S-RNA sequencing
      and mass-spectrometry were performed in adult (8 months) and aged (14 months)
      3xTg-AD mice with a high-fat or control diet. Generalized and HFD resistant
      deficiency of lipid accumulation in both liver and W/BAT, hypermetabolism in WAT 
      (adulthood) and BAT (aging), abnormal cytokine-hormone profiles, and liver
      inflammation were observed in 3xTg mice; INI could antagonize all these
      alterations. Specific gut microbiota-metabolome profiles correlated with a
      significant disruption of the gut-microbiota-liver-adipose axis in AD mice. In
      conclusion, fat dystrophy in liver and adipose depots contributes to AD
      progression, and associates with altered profiles of the gut microbiota, which
      candidates as an appealing early target for preventive intervention.

TI  - Foliar Application of Wood Distillate Alleviates Ozone-Induced Damage in Lettuce 
      (Lactuca sativa L.).
LID - 178 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxics10040178 [doi]
AB  - This study examined whether foliar applications of wood distillate (WD) have a
      protective effect on photosynthesis and the antioxidant power of lettuce when
      exposed to an ecologically relevant O3 concentration. Seedlings of lettuce
      (Lactuca sativa L.) were fumigated daily with 60 ppb of O3 for 30 days, five
      hours per day. Once per week, 50% of the fumigated plants were treated with
      foliar applications of 0.2% WD, while control plants were treated with water. The
      results clearly showed the ability of WD to protect lettuce plants from
      ozone-induced damage. Specifically, WD-treated plants exhibited lower damage to
      the photosynthetic machinery, assessed through a series of chlorophyll
      fluorescence parameters, a higher chlorophyll content, higher antioxidant power, 
      as well as antioxidant molecules, i.e., caffeic acid and quercetin, and higher
      biomass. Counteracting the overproduction of ozone-generated reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) is speculated to be the main mechanism by which WD protects the
      plant from ozone-induced damage.

      Metastasis and Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 2823-2834
LID - 10.3390/curroncol29040230 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) shows complex mechanisms of
      spreading of the tumor cells, up to remote areas, and little is still known of
      these mechanisms, thus we focused on MRI abnormalities observable in the tumor
      and the brain adjacent to the lesion, up to the contralateral hemisphere, with a 
      special interest on tensor diffusion imaging informing on white matter
      architecture; (2) Material and Methods: volumes, macroscopic volume (MV),
      brain-adjacent-tumor (BAT) volume and abnormal color-coded DTI volume (aCCV), and
      region-of-interest samples (probe volumes, ipsi, and contra lateral to the
      lesion), with their MRI characteristics, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC),
      fractional anisotropy (FA) values, and number of fibers (DTI fiber tracking) were
      analyzed in patients suffering GBM (n = 15) and metastasis (n = 9), and healthy
      subjects (n = 15), using ad hoc statistical methods (type I error = 5%) (3)
      Results: GBM volumes were larger than metastasis volumes, aCCV being larger in
      GBM and BAT ADC was higher in metastasis, ADC decreased centripetally in
      metastasis, FA increased centripetally either in GBM or metastasis, MV and BAT FA
      values were higher in GBM, ipsi FA values of GBM ROIs were higher than those of
      metastasis, and the GBM ipsi number of fibers was higher than the GBM contra
      number of fibers; (4) Conclusions: The MV, BAT and especially the aCCV, as well
      as their related water diffusion characteristics, could be useful biomarkers in
      oncology and functional oncology.

TI  - The Early Season Community of Flower-Visiting Arthropods in a High-Altitude
      Alpine Environment.
LID - 393 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13040393 [doi]
AB  - In mountain ecosystems, climate change can cause spatiotemporal shifts, impacting
      the composition of communities and altering fundamental biotic interactions, such
      as those involving flower-visiting arthropods. On of the main problems in
      assessing the effects of climate change on arthropods in these environments is
      the lack of baseline data. In particular, the arthropod communities on early
      flowering high-altitude plants are poorly investigated, although the early season
      is a critical moment for possible mismatches. In this study, we characterised the
      flower-visiting arthropod community on the early flowering high-altitude Alpine
      plant, Androsace brevis (Primulaceae). In addition, we tested the effect of
      abiotic factors (temperature and wind speed) and other variables (time, i.e.,
      hour of the day, and number of flowers per plant) on the occurrence, abundance,
      and diversity of this community. A. brevis is a vulnerable endemic species
      growing in the Central Alps above 2000 m asl and flowering for a very short
      period immediately after snowmelt, thus representing a possible focal plant for
      arthropods in this particular moment of the season. Diptera and Hymenoptera were 
      the main flower visitors, and three major features of the community emerged: an
      evident predominance of anthomyiid flies among Diptera, a rare presence of bees, 
      and a relevant share of parasitoid wasps. Temperature and time (hour of the day),
      but not wind speed and number of flowers per plant, affected the flower visitors'
      activity. Our study contributes to (1) defining the composition of high-altitude 
      Alpine flower-visiting arthropod communities in the early season, (2)
      establishing how these communities are affected by environmental variables, and
      (3) setting the stage for future evaluation of climate change effects on
      flower-visiting arthropods in high-altitude environments in the early season.

TI  - Rutin-activated adipose tissue thermogenesis is correlated with increased
      intestinal short-chain fatty acid levels.
PG  - 2495-2510
LID - 10.1002/ptr.7462 [doi]
AB  - The activation of thermogenic programs in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white
      adipose tissue (WAT) provides a promising approach to increasing energy
      expenditure during obesity and diabetes treatment. Although evidence has been
      found that rutin activates BAT against obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM), its potential mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, we
      focused on the potential modulating effect of rutin on short-chain fatty acids
      (SCFAs) and the thermogenesis of BAT and WAT, aiming to elucidate the molecular
      mechanism of rutin in the treatment of obesity and T2DM. The results showed that 
      rutin could significantly reduce the body weight and fasting blood glucose,
      inhibit fat accumulation, relieve hepatic steatosis and ameliorate the disorder
      of glycolipid metabolism in db/db mice. Moreover, rutin also increased the
      expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and other thermogenic genes and
      proteins in BAT and inguinal WAT (IWAT), indicating that rutin activated BAT and 
      induced browning of IWAT. Importantly, rutin markedly enhanced the concentration 
      of SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and SCFA-producing enzymes (acetate
      kinase (ACK), methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MMD) and butyryl-CoA (BUT)) in
      feces of db/db mice. In addition, rutin significantly increased the mRNA
      expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (Mct1), catabolic enzyme acyl-CoA
      medium-chain synthetase 3 (Acsm3), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1alpha
      (Cpt-1alpha) and Cpt-1beta genes in BAT and IWAT of db/db mice, which is
      conducive to inducing adipocyte thermogenesis. In summary, our findings revealed 
      that rutin played a variety of regulatory roles in improving glucose and lipid
      metabolism disorders, reducing hepatic steatosis, inducing browning of IWAT and
      activating BAT, which has potential therapeutic significance for the treatment of
      obesity and T2DM. Mechanistically, rutin activates the thermogenesis of BAT and
      IWAT, which may be associated with increasing the concentration of SCFAs.

AB  - Some Solanaceae plants are a rich source of sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins with
      allelopathic potential. Powder and aqueous extract obtained from the leaves of
      Solanum linnaeanum Hepper & P.M.L. Jaeger were used to treat the seeds of three
      target species (Lolium multiflorum Lam., Sinapis alba L. and Trifolium incarnatum
      L.). Both matrices were evaluated along with untreated controls to determine
      their toxicity on germination and seedling growth. The results revealed that the 
      pre-emergence treatments were able to be very effective against all three species
      in the filter paper test by inhibiting the germination up to 100 %. The
      effectiveness was reduced by the interaction with soil. Despite this, significant
      data were obtained, albeit different according to the applied matrix. In general,
      L. multiflorum was the most sensitive to both the action of the leaf powder and
      aqueous extract while S. alba was found to be the most resistant to powder
      activity and T. incarnatum had the strongest response to the extract. For the
      first time, SPME-GC/MS technique was used to characterize the volatile chemical
      profile of S. linnaeanum leaves. The analyses highlighted the presence of
      different classes of compounds including terpenoids and sesquiterpenoids
      potentially useful in the fight against noxious plants both in natural and
      cultivated ecosystems.

AB  - Our understanding of the still unfolding severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic would have been extremely limited without the
      study of the genetics and evolution of this new human coronavirus. Large-scale
      genome-sequencing efforts have provided close to real-time tracking of the global
      spread and diversification of SARS-CoV-2 since its entry into the human
      population in late 2019. These data have underpinned analysis of its origins,
      epidemiology, and adaptations to the human population: principally immune evasion
      and increasing transmissibility. SARS-CoV-2, despite being a new human pathogen, 
      was highly capable of human-to-human transmission. During its rapid spread in
      humans, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved independent new forms, the so-called "variants of 
      concern," that are better optimized for human-to-human transmission. The most
      important adaptation of the bat coronavirus progenitor of both SARS-CoV-1 and
      SARS-CoV-2 for human infection (and other mammals) is the use of the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Relaxed structural constraints
      provide plasticity to SARS-related coronavirus spike protein permitting it to
      accommodate significant amino acid replacements of antigenic consequence without 
      compromising the ability to bind to ACE2. Although the bulk of research has
      justifiably concentrated on the viral spike protein as the main determinant of
      antigenic evolution and changes in transmissibility, there is accumulating
      evidence for the contribution of other regions of the viral proteome to
      virus-host interaction. Whereas levels of community transmission of recombinants 
      compromising genetically distinct variants are at present low, when divergent
      variants cocirculate, recombination between SARS-CoV-2 clades is being detected, 
      increasing the risk that viruses with new properties emerge. Applying
      computational and machine learning methods to genome sequence data sets to
      generate experimentally verifiable predictions will serve as an early warning
      system for novel variant surveillance and will be important in future vaccine
      planning. Omicron, the latest SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, has focused
      attention on step change antigenic events, "shift," as opposed to incremental
      "drift" changes in antigenicity. Both an increase in transmissibility and
      antigenic shift in Omicron led to it readily causing infections in the fully
      vaccinated and/or previously infected. Omicron's virulence, while reduced
      relative to the variant of concern it replaced, Delta, is very much premised on
      the past immune exposure of individuals with a clear signal that boosted
      vaccination protects from severe disease. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 has proven itself
      to be a dangerous new human respiratory pathogen with an unpredictable
      evolutionary capacity, leading to a risk of future variants too great not to
      ensure all regions of the world are screened by viral genome sequencing,
      protected through available and affordable vaccines, and have non-punitive
      strategies in place for detecting and responding to novel variants of concern.

LID - 10.1186/s40101-022-00290-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interest in human physiological responses to cold stress have seen 
      a resurgence in recent years with a focus on brown adipose tissue (BAT), a
      mitochondria dense fat specialized for heat production. However, a majority of
      the work examining BAT has been conducted among temperate climate populations.
      METHODS: To expand our understanding of BAT thermogenesis in a cold climate
      population, we measured, using indirect calorimetry and thermal imaging,
      metabolic rate and body surface temperatures of BAT-positive and BAT-negative
      regions at room temperature, and mild cold exposure of resting participants from 
      a small sample of reindeer herders (N = 22, 6 females) from sub-Arctic Finland.
      RESULTS: We found that most herders experienced a significant mean 8.7% increase 
      in metabolic rates, preferentially metabolized fatty acids, and maintained
      relatively warmer body surface temperatures at the supraclavicular region (known 
      BAT location) compared to the sternum, which has no associated BAT. These results
      indicate that the herders in this sample exhibit active BAT thermogenesis in
      response to mild cold exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the rapidly
      growing body of work looking at the physiological and thermoregulatory
      significance of BAT and the important role it may play among cold stressed
      populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to synthesize the empirical economic evidence of
      pharmaceutical therapies for people with dementia. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic
      review and meta-analysis. Literature evaluating the costs and effects of drug
      therapies for dementia was indexed until December 2021. Quality of study was
      assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Consensus on Health Economic
      Criteria list. Cost data were standardized to 2020 US dollars and analyzed from
      healthcare service and societal perspectives. Random-effects models were used to 
      synthesize economic and clinical data, based on mean differences (MDs) and
      standardized MDs. RESULTS: Ten unique studies were identified from 11,771
      records. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine improved
      dementia-related symptoms, alongside nonsignificant savings in societal cost
      (AChEIs: MD-2002 [- 4944 ~ 939]; memantine: MD-6322 [- 14355 ~ 1711]). Despite
      decreases in cost, antidepressants of mirtazapine and sertraline and
      second-generation antipsychotics were limited by their significant side effects
      on patients' cognitive and activity functions. Subgroup analysis indicated that
      the impacts of AChEIs on cost were affected by different analytical perspectives,
      follow-up periods, and participant age. CONCLUSIONS: AChEIs and memantine are
      cost-effective with improvements in dementia-related symptoms and trends of
      cost-savings. More empirical evidence with non-industrial sponsorships and
      rigorous design in different settings is warranted.

AB  - Reduced food availability is implicated in declines in avian aerial insectivores,
      but the effect of nutritional stress on mammalian aerial insectivores is unclear.
      Unlike birds, insectivorous bats provision their young through lactation, which
      might protect nursing juveniles when prey availability is low but could increase 
      the energetic burden on lactating females. We analyzed a 15-year
      capture-mark-recapture data set from 5312 individual little brown myotis (Myotis 
      lucifugus) captured at 11 maternity colonies in northwestern Canada, to test the 
      hypothesis that nutritional stress is impacting these mammalian aerial
      insectivores. We used long-bone (forearm [FA]) length as a proxy for relative
      access to nutrition during development, and body mass as a proxy for access to
      nutrition prior to capture. Average FA length and body mass both decreased
      significantly over the study period in adult females and juveniles, suggesting
      decreased access to nutrition. Effect sizes were very small, similar to those
      reported for declining body size in avian aerial insectivores. Declines in
      juvenile body mass were only observed in individuals captured in late summer when
      they were foraging independently, supporting our hypothesis that lactation
      provides some protection to nursing young during periods of nutritional stress.
      Potential drivers of the decline in bat size include one or both of (1) declining
      insect (prey) abundance, and (2) declining prey availability. Echolocating
      insectivorous bats cannot forage effectively during rainfall, which is increasing
      in our study area. The body mass of captured adult females and juveniles in our
      study was lower, on average, after periods of high rainfall, and higher after
      warmer-than-average periods. Finally, survival models revealed a positive
      association between FA length and survival, suggesting a fitness consequence to
      declines in body size. Our study area has not yet been impacted by bat white-nose
      syndrome (WNS), but research elsewhere has suggested that fatter bats are more
      likely to survive infection. We found evidence for WNS-independent shifts in the 
      body size of little brown myotis, which can inform studies investigating
      population responses to WNS. More broadly, the cumulative effects of multiple
      stressors (e.g., disease, nutritional stress, climate change, and other
      pressures) on mammalian aerial insectivores require urgent attention.

AB  - Bat communities can usually only be comprehensively monitored by combining
      ultrasound recording and trapping techniques. Here, we propose bat point counts, 
      a novel, single method to sample all flying bats. We designed a sampling rig that
      combines a thermal scope to detect flying bats and their flight patterns, an
      ultrasound recorder to identify echolocating bat calls, and a near-infrared
      camera and LED illuminator to photograph bat morphology. We evaluated the
      usefulness of the flight pattern information, echolocation call recordings, and
      near-infrared photographs produced by our sampling rig to determine a workflow to
      process these heterogenous data types. We present a conservative workflow to
      enable taxonomic discrimination and identification of bat detections. Our
      sampling rig and workflow allowed us to detect both echolocating and
      non-echolocating bats and we could assign 84% of the detections to a guild.
      Subsequent identification can be carried out with established methods such as
      taxonomic keys and call libraries, based on the visible morphological features
      and echolocation calls. Currently, a higher near-infrared picture quality is
      required to resolve more detailed diagnostic morphology, but there is
      considerable potential to extract more information with higher-intensity
      illumination. This is the first proof-of-concept for bat point counts, a method
      that can passively sample all flying bats in their natural environment.

TI  - White-Nose Syndrome Pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans Detected in Migratory
      Tree-Roosting Bats.
PG  - 652-657
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00160 [doi]
AB  - White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging fungal epizootic disease that has caused
      large-scale mortality in several species of North American bats. The fungus that 
      causes WNS, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), has also been detected in bat
      species without diagnostic signs of WNS. Although these species could play a role
      in WNS spread, understanding of the spatial and temporal extents of Pd occurrence
      on WNS-resistant species is limited. This study evaluated the presence of Pd on
      272 individuals of three species of migratory tree-roosting bats: hoary (Lasiurus
      cinereus), eastern red (Lasiurus borealis), and silver-haired (Lasionycteris
      noctivagans) bats, obtained opportunistically during summer and autumn from
      throughout much of their ranges in North America. We also compared tissue
      sampling protocols (i.e., tissue swabbing, fur swabbing, and DNA extraction of
      excised wing tissue). We detected Pd on three eastern red bats from Illinois and 
      Ohio, US, one silver-haired bat from West Virginia, US, and one hoary bat from
      New York, US, all via DNA extracted from wing tissue of carcasses. These results 
      document the first publicly reported detections of Pd on a hoary bat and on
      migratory bats during the autumn migratory period, and demonstrate the potential 
      for using carcasses salvaged at wind-energy facilities to monitor for Pd.

TI  - Racket or Bat Sports: No Association With Thumb-Base Osteoarthritis.
PG  - 341-351
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-0208.21 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Repetitive joint use is a risk factor for osteoarthritis, which is a
      leading cause of disability. Sports requiring a racket or bat to perform
      repetitive high-velocity impacts may increase the risk of thumb-base
      osteoarthritis. However, this hypothesis remains untested. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine if a history of participation in racket or bat sports was associated
      with the prevalence of thumb-base osteoarthritis. DESIGN: Descriptive
      epidemiologic study. SETTING: Four US clinical sites associated with the
      Osteoarthritis Initiative. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 2309 men 
      and women from the community. Eligible participants had dominant-hand
      radiographic readings, hand symptom assessments, and historical physical activity
      survey data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): A history of exposure to racket or bat
      sports (badminton, baseball or softball, racketball or squash, table tennis [or
      ping pong], tennis [doubles], or tennis [singles]) was based on self-reported
      recall data covering 3 age ranges (12-18, 19-34, and 35-49 years). Prevalent
      radiographic thumb-base osteoarthritis was defined as Kellgren-Lawrence grade >2 
      in the first carpometacarpal joint or scaphotrapezoidal joint at the
      Osteoarthritis Initiative baseline visit. Symptomatic thumb-base osteoarthritis
      was defined as radiographic osteoarthritis and hand or finger symptoms. RESULTS: 
      Radiographic or symptomatic thumb-base osteoarthritis was present in 355 (34%)
      and 56 (5%), respectively, of men (total = 1049) and 535 (42%) and 170 (13%),
      respectively, of women (total = 1260). After adjusting for age, race, and
      education level, we found no significant associations between a history of any
      racket or bat sport participation and thumb-base osteoarthritis (radiographic or 
      symptomatic; odds ratios ranged from 0.82 to 1.34). CONCLUSIONS: In a
      community-based cohort, a self-reported history of participation in racket or bat
      sports was not associated with increased odds of having radiographic or
      symptomatic thumb-base osteoarthritis in the dominant hand.

TI  - Longitudinal deep sequencing informs vector selection and future deployment
      strategies for transmissible vaccines.
PG  - e3001580
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001580 [doi]
AB  - Vaccination is a powerful tool in combating infectious diseases of humans and
      companion animals. In most wildlife, including reservoirs of emerging human
      diseases, achieving sufficient vaccine coverage to mitigate disease burdens
      remains logistically unattainable. Virally vectored "transmissible" vaccines that
      deliberately spread among hosts are a potentially transformative, but still
      theoretical, solution to the challenge of immunising inaccessible wildlife.
      Progress towards real-world application is frustrated by the absence of
      frameworks to guide vector selection and vaccine deployment prior to major in
      vitro and in vivo investments in vaccine engineering and testing. Here, we
      performed deep sequencing on field-collected samples of Desmodus rotundus
      betaherpesvirus (DrBHV), a candidate vector for a transmissible vaccine targeting
      vampire bat-transmitted rabies. We discovered 11 strains of DrBHV that varied in 
      prevalence and geographic distribution across Peru. The phylogeographic structure
      of DrBHV strains was predictable from both host genetics and landscape topology, 
      informing long-term DrBHV-vectored vaccine deployment strategies and identifying 
      geographic areas for field trials where vaccine spread would be naturally
      contained. Multistrain infections were observed in 79% of infected bats.
      Resampling of marked individuals over 4 years showed within-host persistence
      kinetics characteristic of latency and reactivation, properties that might boost 
      individual immunity and lead to sporadic vaccine transmission over the lifetime
      of the host. Further, strain acquisitions by already infected individuals implied
      that preexisting immunity and strain competition are unlikely to inhibit vaccine 
      spread. Our results support the development of a transmissible vaccine targeting 
      a major source of human and animal rabies in Latin America and show how genomics 
      can enlighten vector selection and deployment strategies for transmissible
      vaccines.

PG  - 1370-1392

AB  - Humans have a remarkable capacity for perceiving and producing rhythm. Rhythmic
      competence is often viewed as a single concept, with participants who perform
      more or less accurately on a single rhythm task. However, research is revealing
      numerous sub-processes and competencies involved in rhythm perception and
      production, which can be selectively impaired or enhanced. To investigate whether
      different patterns of performance emerge across tasks and individuals, we
      measured performance across a range of rhythm tasks from different test
      batteries. Distinct performance patterns could potentially reveal separable
      rhythmic competencies that may draw on distinct neural mechanisms. Participants
      completed nine rhythm perception and production tasks selected from the Battery
      for the Assessment of Auditory Sensorimotor and Timing Abilities (BAASTA), the
      Beat Alignment Test (BAT), the Beat-Based Advantage task (BBA), and two tasks
      from the Burgundy best Musical Aptitude Test (BbMAT). Principal component
      analyses revealed clear separation of task performance along three main
      dimensions: production, beat-based rhythm perception, and sequence memory-based
      rhythm perception. Hierarchical cluster analyses supported these results,
      revealing clusters of participants who performed selectively more or less
      accurately along different dimensions. The current results support the hypothesis
      of divergence of rhythmic skills. Based on these results, we provide guidelines
      towards a comprehensive testing of rhythm abilities, including at least three
      short tasks measuring: (1) rhythm production (e.g., tapping to metronome/music), 
      (2) beat-based rhythm perception (e.g., BAT), and (3) sequence memory-based
      rhythm processing (e.g., BBA). Implications for underlying neural mechanisms,
      future research, and potential directions for rehabilitation and training
      programs are discussed.

TI  - Three-dimensional visualization of electroacupuncture-induced activation of brown
      adipose tissue via sympathetic innervation in PCOS rats.
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/s13020-022-00603-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to ameliorate
      obesity and reproductive dysfunctions in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome 
      (PCOS), and further explorations in PCOS-like rats showed that EA could affect
      white adipose tissue. However, the function and neuromodulation of brown adipose 
      tissue (BAT) in PCOS and after EA treatment have remained unknown. The present
      study focused on the role of BAT in PCOS-like rats and its relationship with EA
      and characterized the three-dimensional (3D) innervation of BAT associated with
      activation molecules. METHODS: Female rats (21 days old) were implanted with
      dihydrotestosterone or fed with a high fat diet to establish PCOS-like and
      obesity models, respectively, and then EA treatment at "Guilai" (ST 29) and
      "Sanyinjiao" (SP 6) was carried out for 4 weeks. In the present study,
      morphological analysis, 3D imaging, molecular biology, and other experimental
      techniques were used to study the sympathetic nerves and activity of BAT.
      RESULTS: PCOS-like rats showed both obvious weight gain and reproductive
      dysfunction, similar to what was seen in obese rats except for the absence of
      reproductive dysfunction. The body weight gain was mainly caused by an increase
      in white adipose tissue, and there was an abnormal decrease in BAT. Because both 
      the lipid metabolism and reproductive disorders could be improved with bilateral 
      EA at "Guilai" (ST 29) and "Sanyinjiao" (SP 6), especially the restoration of
      BAT, we further investigated the neuromodulation and inflammation in BAT and
      identified the sympathetic marker tyrosine hydroxylase as one of the key factors 
      of sympathetic nerves. Modified adipo-clearing technology and 3D high-resolution 
      imaging showed that crooked or dispersed sympathetic nerves, but not the twisted 
      vasculature, were reconstructed and associated with the activation of BAT and are
      likely to be the functional target for EA treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study
      highlights the significant role of BAT and its sympathetic innervations in PCOS
      and in EA therapy.

TI  - Field assessment of organic amendments and spring barley to phytomanage a
      Cu/PAH-contaminated soil.
LID - 10.1007/s10653-022-01269-x [doi]
AB  - The INTENSE project, supported by the EU Era-Net Facce Surplus, aimed at
      increasing crop production on marginal land, including those with contaminated
      soils. A field trial was set up at a former wood preservation site to phytomanage
      a Cu/PAH-contaminated sandy soil. The novelty was to assess the influence of five
      organic amendments differing in their composition and production process, i.e.
      solid fractions before and after biodigestion of pig manure, compost and compost 
      pellets (produced from spent mushroom substrate, biogas digestate and straw), and
      greenwaste compost, on Cu availability, soil properties, nutrient supply, and
      plant growth. Organic amendments were incorporated into the soil at 2.3% and 5%
      soil w/w. Total soil Cu varied from 179 to 1520 mg kg(-1), and 1 M
      NH4NO3-extractable soil Cu ranged from 4.7 to 104 mg kg(-1) across the 25 plots. 
      Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Ella) was cultivated in plots. Changes in
      physico-chemical soil properties, shoot DW yield, shoot ionome, and shoot Cu
      uptake depending on extractable soil Cu and the soil treatments are reported.
      Shoot Cu concentration varied from 45 +/- 24 to 140 +/- 193 mg kg DW(-1) and
      generally increased with extractable soil Cu. Shoot DW yield, shoot Cu
      concentration, and shoot Cu uptake of barley plants did not significantly differ 
      across the soil treatments in year 1. Based on soil and plant parameters, the
      effects of the compost and pig manure treatments were globally discriminated from
      those of the untreated, greenwaste compost and digested pig manure treatments.
      Compost and its pellets at the 5% addition rate promoted soil functions related
      to primary production, water purification, and soil fertility, and the soil
      quality index.

TI  - Descriptive and Time-Series Analysis of Rabies in Different Animal Species in
      Mexico.

AB  - The spatio-temporal epidemiology of rabies has related the influence of
      environmental factors and anthropogenic changes on the movements of the
      hematophagous bat Desmodus rotundus. In Mexico, D. rotundus is the main
      transmitter of the rabies virus for different livestock species, modifying
      annually the fluctuation of the number of cases of rabies and its dissemination
      in subtropical areas and regions considered free of the disease. The purpose of
      this study was to perform a descriptive analysis of the distribution of cases of 
      rabies in Mexico, and to perform a time-series analysis to evaluate stationarity 
      and to predict the number of cases for the following year. A total of 3,469 cases
      were reported in the period of interest, of which the 89.1% occurred in cattle,
      4.3% in horses, 1.5% in sheep, 0.6% in goats, 0.01% in pig, 3.1% in vampire bats,
      0.3% in cervids, 0.2% in skunks, 0.1% in insectivorous bats, 0.1% in foxes, 0.1% 
      in buffaloes, and 0.02% in coatis; 0.5% were not identified. The most frequent
      antigenic variants reported were AgV11, AgV5, and AgV3, associated with D.
      rotundus. The distribution of cases in bats correlates with the distribution of
      cases in domestic and wild animals; however, cases were observed in wild species 
      in non-endemic areas of Mexico, like the State of Chihuahua. The additive model
      used in the time-series analysis showed a seasonal pattern with a peak of cases
      at the beginning of each year, from January to March. The model showed a good
      predicting value; the Pearson correlation coefficient R(2) was 0.705. The highest
      probability for the occurrence of rabies cases in the different species estimated
      by Ordinary Kriging was in the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, involving the states 
      of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Yucatan. This study confirms that 
      rabies in domestic and wild species is endemic in tropical and subtropical
      areas-however, cases have been observed in new geographic areas-and provides
      useful information to support actions to stop the spread of the rabies virus or
      the reservoir, and for planning vaccination strategies considering time and
      place.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be the product of a natural or artificial
      recombination of two viruses - one adapted to the horseshoe bat and the other,
      donor of the spike protein gene, adapted to an unknown species. Here we used a
      new method to search for the original host of the ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2
      virus and for the donor of its gene for the spike protein, the molecule
      responsible for binding to and entering human cells. We computed immunological
      T-distances (the number of different peptides that are present in the viral
      proteins but absent in proteins of the host) between 11 species of coronaviruses 
      and 38 representatives of the main mammal clades. Analyses of pentapeptides, the 
      presumed principal targets of T-cell non-self recognition, showed the smallest
      T-distance of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to humans, while the rest of
      SARS-CoV-2 proteome to the horseshoe bat. This suggests that the ancestor of
      SARS-CoV-2 was adapted to bats, but the spike gene donor was adapted to humans.
      Further analyses suggest that the ancestral coronavirus adapted to bats was
      shortly passaged in treeshrews, while the donor of the spike gene was shortly
      passaged in rats before the recombination event.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification of BAHD Superfamily and Functional Characterization of
      Bornyl Acetyltransferases Involved in the Bornyl Acetate Biosynthesis in
      Wurfbainia villosa.
PG  - 860152
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2022.860152 [doi]
AB  - Bornyl acetate (BA) is known as a natural aromatic monoterpene ester with a wide 
      range of pharmacological and biological activities. Borneol acetyltransferase
      (BAT), catalyzing borneol and acetyl-CoA to synthesize BA, is alcohol
      acetyltransferase, which belongs to the BAHD super acyltransferase family,
      however, BAT, responsible for the biosynthesis of BA, has not yet been
      characterized. The seeds of Wurfbainia villosa (homotypic synonym: Amomum
      villosum) are rich in BA. Here we identified 64 members of the BAHD gene family
      from the genome of W. villosa using both PF02458 (transferase) and PF07247
      (AATase) as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to screen the BAHD genes. A total of
      sixty-four WvBAHDs are distributed on 14 chromosomes and nine unanchored contigs,
      clustering into six clades; three WvBAHDs with PF07247 have formed a separated
      and novel clade: clade VI. Twelve candidate genes belonging to clade I-a, I-b,
      and VI were selected to clone and characterize in vitro, among which eight genes 
      have been identified to encode BATs acetylating at least one type of borneol to
      synthesize BA. All eight WvBATs can utilize (-)-borneol as substrates, but only
      five WvBATs can catalyze (+)-borneol, which is the endogenous borneol substrate
      in the seeds of W. villosa; WvBAT3 and WvBAT4 present the better catalytic
      efficiency on (+)-borneol than the others. The temporal and spatial expression
      patterns of WvBATs indicate that WvBAT3 and WvBAT4 are seed-specific expression
      genes, and their expression levels are correlated with the accumulation of BA,
      suggesting WvBAT3 and WvBAT4 might be the two key BATs for BA synthesis in the
      seeds of W. villosa. This is the first report on BAT responsible for the last
      biosynthetic step of BA, which will contribute to further studies on BA
      biosynthesis and metabolism engineering of BA in other plants or heterologous
      hosts.

AB  - Host-associated skin bacteria are essential for resisting pathogen infections and
      maintaining health. However, we have little understanding of how chiropteran skin
      microbiota are distributed among bat species and their habitats, or of their
      putative roles in defending against Pseudogymnoascus destructans in China. In
      this study, we characterized the skin microbiomes of four bat species at five
      localities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to understand their skin
      microbial composition, structure, and putative relationship with disease. The
      alpha- and beta-diversities of skin microbiota differed significantly among the
      bat species, and the differences were affected by environmental temperature,
      sampling sites, and host body condition. The chiropteran skin microbial
      communities were enriched in bacterial taxa that had low relative abundances in
      the environment. Most of the potential functions of skin microbiota in bat
      species were associated with metabolism. Focusing on their functions of defense
      against pathogens, we found that skin microbiota could metabolize a variety of
      active substances that could be potentially used to fight P. destructans. The
      skin microbial communities of bats in China are related to the environment and
      the bat host, and may be involved in the host's defense against pathogens.

      Intact.
PG  - 858417

AB  - Due to its high metabolic activity, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has become a
      promising target for the development of novel treatment concepts for metabolic
      disease. Despite several reports of a negative association between the presence
      of active BAT and obesity, very little is known about the quantitative and
      qualitative differences of BAT in lean and obese individuals. Systematic studies 
      directly comparing cold-induced BAT activity in leanness and obesity are
      currently lacking. Here we studied BAT mass and function in 31 lean and 64 obese 
      men and women. After a standardized cooling protocol using a water-perfused vest,
      (18)F-FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans were performed, 
      and BAT was delineated using lean body-mass adjusted standardized uptake value
      (SUV) thresholds in anatomic regions with fat radiodensity. Cold-induced
      thermogenesis (CIT), a functional readout of BAT activity, was quantified by
      indirect calorimetry. Active BAT was present in a significantly higher proportion
      of lean than obese individuals (58% vs. 33%, p=0.019). In these participants with
      active BAT, however, BAT volume and activity did not differ between leanness and 
      obesity. Accordingly, CIT was similar in both weight groups. BAT metrics were not
      related to adiposity or total fat mass per se. However, in obese participants a
      strong negative correlation existed between visceral adipose tissue and BAT
      volume, (18)F-FDG uptake and CIT. In summary, despite a significantly lower
      prevalence of BAT, the metabolic activity and thermogenic capacity of BAT appears
      to be still intact in obesity and is inversely associated with visceral fat mass.

AB  - Multiple studies have investigated bibliometric factors predictive of the
      citation count a research article will receive. In this article, we go beyond
      bibliometric data by using a range of machine learning techniques to find
      patterns predictive of citation count using both article content and available
      metadata. As the input collection, we use the CORD-19 corpus containing research 
      articles-mostly from biology and medicine-applicable to the COVID-19 crisis. Our 
      study employs a combination of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for
      text understanding, including embeddings-based language model BERT, several
      systems for detection and semantic expansion of entities: ConceptNet, Pubtator
      and ScispaCy. To interpret the resulting models, we use several explanation
      algorithms: random forest feature importance, LIME, and Shapley values. We
      compare the performance and comprehensibility of models obtained by "black-box"
      machine learning algorithms (neural networks and random forests) with models
      built with rule learning (CORELS, CBA), which are intrinsically explainable.
      Multiple rules were discovered, which referred to biomedical entities of
      potential interest. Of the rules with the highest lift measure, several rules
      pointed to dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4), a known MERS-CoV receptor and a critical
      determinant of camel to human transmission of the camel coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
      Some other interesting patterns related to the type of animal investigated were
      found. Articles referring to bats and camels tend to draw citations, while
      articles referring to most other animal species related to coronavirus are lowly 
      cited. Bat coronavirus is the only other virus from a non-human species in the
      betaB clade along with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. MERS-CoV is in a
      sister betaC clade, also close to human SARS coronaviruses. Thus both species
      linked to high citation counts harbor coronaviruses which are more
      phylogenetically similar to human SARS viruses. On the other hand, feline (FIPV, 
      FCOV) and canine coronaviruses (CCOV) are in the alpha coronavirus clade and more
      distant from the betaB clade with human SARS viruses. Other results include
      detection of apparent citation bias favouring authors with western sounding
      names. Equal performance of TF-IDF weights and binary word incidence matrix was
      observed, with the latter resulting in better interpretability. The best
      predictive performance was obtained with a "black-box" method-neural network. The
      rule-based models led to most insights, especially when coupled with text
      representation using semantic entity detection methods. Follow-up work should
      focus on the analysis of citation patterns in the context of phylogenetic trees, 
      as well on patterns referring to DPP4, which is currently considered as a
      SARS-Cov-2 therapeutic target.

AB  - Infectious diseases and inflammatory conditions recruit the immune system to
      mount an appropriate acute response that includes the production of cytokines.
      Cytokines evoke neurally-mediated responses to fight pathogens, such as the
      recruitment of thermoeffectors, thereby increasing body temperature and leading
      to fever. Studies suggest that the cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) depends 
      upon cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated prostaglandin E2 production for the induction 
      of neural mechanisms to elicit fever. However, COX inhibitors do not eliminate
      IL-1beta-induced fever, thus suggesting that COX-dependent and COX-independent
      mechanisms are recruited for increasing body temperature after peripheral
      administration of IL-1beta. In the present study, we aimed to build a foundation 
      for the neural circuit(s) controlling COX-independent, inflammatory fever by
      determining the involvement of brain areas that are critical for controlling the 
      sympathetic outflow to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the cutaneous vasculature. 
      In anesthetized rats, pretreatment with indomethacin, a non-selective COX
      inhibitor, did not prevent BAT thermogenesis or cutaneous vasoconstriction (CVC) 
      induced by intravenous IL-1beta (2 microg/kg). BAT and cutaneous vasculature
      sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral raphe pallidus area (rRPa) are
      required for IL-1beta-evoked BAT thermogenesis and CVC, with or without
      pretreatment with indomethacin. Additionally, activation of glutamate receptors
      in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) is required for COX-independent,
      IL-1beta-induced BAT thermogenesis. Therefore, our data suggests that
      COX-independent mechanisms elicit activation of neurons within the DMH and rRPa, 
      which is sufficient to trigger and mount inflammatory fever. These data provide a
      foundation for elucidating the brain circuits responsible for COX-independent,
      IL-1beta-elicited fevers.

AB  - Cold-induced activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) has an important impact on 
      systemic lipoprotein metabolism by accelerating the processing of circulating
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expressed by
      adipocytes is translocated via endothelial to the capillary lumen, where LPL acts
      as the central enzyme for the vascular lipoprotein processing. Based on
      preliminary data showing that LPL is not only expressed in adipocytes but also in
      endothelial cells of cold-activated BAT, we aimed to dissect the relevance of
      endothelial versus adipocyte LPL for lipid and energy metabolism in the context
      of adaptive thermogenesis. By metabolic studies we found that cold-induced
      triglyceride uptake into BAT, lipoprotein disposal, glucose uptake and adaptive
      thermogenesis were not impaired in mice lacking Lpl exclusively in endothelial
      cells. This finding may be explained by a compensatory upregulation in the
      expression of adipocyte-derived Lpl and endothelial lipase (Lipg).

AB  - We report a case of a young male with amphetamine toxicity initially obscured by 
      concomitant use of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and the sympathomimetic symptoms 
      emerged after GHB's effects receded. A 24-year-old unconscious man presented to
      emergency department showed the following vital signs upon admission: blood
      pressure 136/58 mmHg; heart rate 79 bpm; SpO2 87% under ambient air; body
      temperature 36.1 degrees C; Glasgow Coma Scale score 3. The pupils were not
      dilated. Arterial blood gas test revealed respiratory acidosis (pH = 7.229, pCO2 
      = 64.4 mmHg, pO2 = 42.3 mmHg, HCO3 = 26.3 mmol/L). Intubation was performed and
      the patient was transferred to intensive care unit. The patient regained
      consciousness and became agitated in association with sinus tachycardia
      (heartrate 143 bpm; blood pressure 173/61 mmHg). A few hours later, he
      experienced abrupt desaturation (SpO2 65%) and profuse, pinkish, frothy sputum.
      Chest radiography revealed a bat-wing perihilar shadowing, and computed
      tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and an alveolar pattern from
      acute pulmonary edema. A high dose of benzodiazepine with a midazolam pump at 50 
      mg/h was administered to relieve symptoms. The patient's friends confessed to
      concomitant use of amphetamine and GHB. The urine toxicology result was positive 
      for amphetamine (>==500 ng/mL). The patient improved later and was extubated at 4
      days after the mitigation of pneumonia and discharged uneventfully 8 days later. 
      In our patient, amphetamine intoxication was initially masked by concomitant use 
      of GHB but appeared as GHB's effect attenuated. We wish to remind clinicians of
      variable clinical presentations of polydrug abuse.

AB  - Bats have recently been identified as potential reservoir hosts for mammalian
      orthoreoviruses (MRVs) throughout Europe and China. Here we present the first
      evolutionary and biological characterization of bat-borne MRVs in North America, 
      including phylogenomic analysis, in vitro relative infectivity in bat and other
      mammalian cell cultures, host cell receptor specificity, and epifluorescence
      microscopy of viral factory formation. Through genetic and phylogenetic
      comparisons, we show that two divergent MRV serotype 2 (T2) strains - isolated
      from a silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and a big brown bat
      (Eptesicus fuscus) from Pennsylvania, USA - provide an evolutionary link to an
      MRV strain (T2W) recovered from an 8-week-old infant who died in Winnipeg,
      Manitoba, Canada in 1997. Although these findings suggest North American bats may
      represent a previously unrecognized source for the cross-species transmission of 
      MRVs to other animals, including humans, the ecology and epidemiology of MRVs in 
      wildlife remain enigmatic.

AB  - The Old World tropical and subtropical frugivorous bat genus Rousettus
      (Pteropodidae) contains species with broad distributions, as well as those
      occurring in restricted geographical areas, particularly islands. Herein we
      review the role of Rousettus as a keystone species from a global "One Health"
      approach and related to ecosystem functioning, zoonotic disease and public
      health. Rousettus are efficient at dispersing seeds and pollinating flowers;
      their role in forest regeneration is related to their ability to fly considerable
      distances during nightly foraging bouts and their relatively small body size,
      which allows them to access fruits in forested areas with closed vegetation.
      Rousettus are also reservoirs for various groups of pathogens (viruses, bacteria,
      fungi, protozoa), which, by definition, are infectious agents causing disease.
      The study of day roosts of different species of Rousettus and the successful
      establishment of captive breeding colonies have provided important details
      related to the infection dynamics of their associated pathogens. Large-scale
      conversion of forested areas into agricultural landscapes has increased contact
      between humans and Rousettus, therefore augmenting the chances of infectious
      agent spillover. Many crucial scientific details are still lacking related to
      members of this genus, which have direct bearing on the prevention of emerging
      disease outbreaks, as well as the conservation of these bats. The public should
      be better informed on the capacity of fruit bats as keystone species for large
      scale forest regeneration and in spreading pathogens. Precise details on the
      transmission of zoonotic diseases of public health importance associated with
      Rousettus should be given high priority.

      Using Bat Algorithm and Deep Neural Networks.

AB  - Electromyograms (EMG) are a recorded galvanic action of nerves and muscles which 
      assists in diagnosing the disorders associated with muscles and nerves. The
      efficient discrimination of abnormal EMG signals, myopathy and amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis, engage crucial role in automatic diagnostic assistance tools, 
      since EMG signals are nonstationary signals. Hence, for computer-aided
      identification of abnormalities, extraction of features, selection of superlative
      feature subset, and developing an efficient classifier are indispensable.
      Initially, time domain and Wigner-Ville transformed time-frequency features were 
      extracted from abnormal EMG signals for experiments. The selection of substantial
      characteristics from time and time-frequency features was performed using bat
      algorithm. Extensively, deep neural network classifier is modelled for selected
      feature subset using bat algorithm from extracted time and time-frequency
      features. The performance of deep neural network exerting selected features from 
      bat algorithm was compared with conventional artificial neural network. Results
      demonstrate that the deep neural network modelled with layers 2 and 3 (neurons = 
      2 and 4) using time domain features is efficient in classifying the abnormalities
      of EMG signals with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100% and also
      exhibited finer performance. Correspondingly, the developed conventional single
      layer artificial neural network (neurons = 7) with time domain features has shown
      an accuracy of 83.3%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 71.42%. The work
      materializes the significance of conventional and deep neural network using time 
      and time-frequency features in diagnosing the abnormal signals exists in
      neuromuscular system using efficient classification.

TI  - Reviewing findings on the polypeptide sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein to
      discuss the origins of the virus.
LID - 10.2217/fvl-2021-0233 [doi]
AB  - Several investigations suggested origins of SARS-CoV-2 from the recombination of 
      coronaviruses of various animals, including the bat Rhinolophus affinis and the
      pangolin Manis javanica, despite the processes describing the adaptation from a
      reservoir of animals to human are still debated. In this perspective, I will
      remark two main inconsistencies on the origins of SARS-CoV-2: polypeptide
      sequence alignment of the S-proteins does not return the expected identity of the
      receptor-binding motif among most of pangolin-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2; accurate
      referencing for samplings and sequencing deposition of the ancestral bat
      coronavirus named RaTG13 was missing since the first reports on the SARS-CoV-2
      coronavirus. This contribution aims to stimulate discussion about the origins of 
      SARS-CoV-2 and considers other intermediate hosts as a reservoir for coronavirus.

AB  - The major reason of human morbidity and mortality is obesity and related
      diseases. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is associated with low total adipose tissue 
      content and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that
      exercise and cold expose may induce browning. In this study, we verified (1)
      whether exercise and/or cold exposure can improve the expression level of ucp4c, 
      serca, ampkalpha, camkII, sirt1, octbeta3r, and hamlet; (2) if these
      interventions can save cardiac dysfunction induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in
      Drosophila. w1118 (wild-type) virgin female flies collected within 8 h after
      eclosion were divided into eight groups: the normal feed control group (NFD-C),
      the normal feed exercise group (NFD-E), the normal feed cold exposure group
      (NFD-CA), the normal feed exercise/cold exposure group (NFD-EC), the HFD control 
      group (HFD-C), the HFD exercise group (HFD-E), the HFD cold exposure group
      (HFD-CA), and the HFD exercise/cold exposure group (HFD-EC). After exercise
      and/or cold exposure for 7 days, the mRNA expression levels of ucp4c, serca,
      ampkalpha, camk II, sirt1, octbeta3r, and hamlet were tested by qRT-PCR, and
      m-mode was used to assess cardiac function. In addition, we assessed the
      triacylglycerol (TAG) levels, motor ability, fat mass (by Oil Red O [ORO]
      staining), and morphological features. The results of TAG, ORO staining, and
      morphological features all indicate that after interventions, body size of
      Drosophila was smaller compared with the control group, irrespective of the
      feeding patterns. The mRNA expression levels of ucp4c, serca, octbeta3r, hamlet, 
      ampkalpha, camkII, and sirt1 were changed to varying degrees under different
      intervention states (exercise and/or cold exposure). Cold exposure and
      exercise/cold exposure partly improved cardiac function and the normal fruit
      flies' cardiac function and exercise ability. However, after exercise
      intervention, exercise ability and heart function were improved in both HFD and
      normal-fat diet (NFD) fruit flies. In conclusion, different intervention states
      (exercise and/or cold exposure) can change the mRNA expression levels of ucp4c,
      serca, octbeta3r, hamlet, ampkalpha, camkII, and sirt1. Exercise is the most
      effective way to restore HFD-induced cardiac dysfunction.

AB  - Despite a huge effort by the scientific community to determine the animal
      reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, which led to the identification of several
      SARS-CoV-2-related viruses both in bats and in pangolins, the origin of
      SARS-CoV-2 is still not clear. Recently, Temmam et al. reported the discovery of 
      bat coronaviruses with a high degree of genome similarity with SARS-CoV-2,
      especially concerning the RBDs of the S protein, which mediates the capability of
      such viruses to enter and therefore infect human cells through a hACE2-dependent 
      pathway. These viruses, especially the one named BANAL-236, showed a higher
      affinity for the hACE2 compared to the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. In the
      present work, we analyse the similarities and differences between the 3CL
      protease (main protease, M(pro)) of these newly reported viruses and SARS-CoV-2, 
      discussing their relevance relative to the efficacy of existing therapeutic
      approaches against COVID-19, particularly concerning the recently approved orally
      available Paxlovid, and the development of future ones.

AB  - Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) undergoes progressive involution. This
      involution process is not recapitulated in rodents, and the underlying mechanisms
      are poorly understood. Here we show that the interscapular BAT (iBAT) of rabbits 
      whitens rapidly during early adulthood. The transcriptomic remodeling and
      identity switch of mature adipocytes are accompanied by loss of brown adipogenic 
      competence of progenitors. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that rabbit and
      human iBAT progenitors highly express the FSTL1 gene. When iBAT involutes in
      rabbits, adipocyte progenitors reduce FSTL1 expression and are refractory to
      brown adipogenic recruitment. Conversely, FSTL1 is constitutively expressed in
      mouse iBAT to sustain WNT signaling and prevent involution. Progenitor
      incompetence and iBAT paucity can be induced in mice by genetic deletion of the
      Fstl1 gene or ablation of Fstl1(+) progenitors. Our results highlight the
      hierarchy and dynamics of the BAT progenitor compartment and implicate the
      functional incompetence of FSTL1-expressing progenitors in BAT involution.

TI  - Real-world analysis of main clinical outcomes in patients with polycythemia vera 
      treated with ruxolitinib or best available therapy after developing
      resistance/intolerance to hydroxyurea.
PG  - 2441-2448
LID - 10.1002/cncr.34195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ruxolitinib is approved for patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who 
      are resistant/intolerant to hydroxyurea, but its impact on preventing thrombosis 
      or disease-progression is unknown. METHODS: A retrospective, real-world analysis 
      was performed on the outcomes of 377 patients with resistance/intolerance to
      hydroxyurea from the Spanish Registry of Polycythemia Vera according to
      subsequent treatment with ruxolitinib (n = 105) or the best available therapy
      (BAT; n = 272). Survival probabilities and rates of thrombosis, hemorrhage, acute
      myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, and second primary cancers were calculated
      according to treatment. To minimize biases in treatment allocation, all results
      were adjusted by a propensity score for receiving ruxolitinib or BAT. RESULTS:
      Patients receiving ruxolitinib had a significantly lower rate of arterial
      thrombosis than those on BAT (0.4% vs 2.3% per year; P = .03), and this persisted
      as a trend after adjustment for the propensity to have received the drug
      (incidence rate ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-1.3; P = .09). There
      were no significant differences in the rates of venous thrombosis (0.8% and 1.1% 
      for ruxolitinib and BAT, respectively; P = .7) and major bleeding (0.8% and 0.9%,
      respectively; P = .9). Ruxolitinib exposure was not associated with a higher rate
      of second primary cancers, including all types of neoplasia, noncutaneous
      cancers, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years,
      there were no differences in survival or progression to acute leukemia or
      myelofibrosis between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that
      ruxolitinib treatment for PV patients with resistance/intolerance to hydroxyurea 
      may reduce the incidence of arterial thrombosis. LAY SUMMARY: Ruxolitinib is
      better than other available therapies in achieving hematocrit control and symptom
      relief in patients with polycythemia vera who are resistant/intolerant to
      hydroxyurea, but we still do not know whether ruxolitinib provides an additional 
      benefit in preventing thrombosis or disease progression. We retrospectively
      studied the outcomes of 377 patients with resistance/intolerance to hydroxyurea
      from the Spanish Registry of Polycythemia Vera according to whether they
      subsequently received ruxolitinib (n = 105) or the best available therapy (n =
      272). Our findings suggest that ruxolitinib could reduce the incidence of
      arterial thrombosis, but a disease-modifying effect could not be demonstrated for
      ruxolitinib in this patient population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) burns fatty acids (FAs) to produce heat,
      and shows diurnal oscillation in glucose and triglyceride (TG)-derived FA-uptake,
      peaking around wakening. Here we aimed to gain insight in the diurnal regulation 
      of metabolic BAT activity. METHODS: RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation
      (ChIP)-sequencing, and lipidomics analyses were performed on BAT samples of wild 
      type C57BL/6J mice collected at 3-hour intervals throughout the day. Knockout and
      overexpression models were used to study causal relationships in diurnal lipid
      handling by BAT. RESULTS: We identified pronounced enrichment of oscillating
      genes involved in extracellular lipolysis in BAT, accompanied by oscillations of 
      FA and monoacylglycerol content. This coincided with peak lipoprotein lipase
      (Lpl) expression, and was predicted to be driven by peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) activity. ChIP-sequencing for
      PPARgamma confirmed oscillation in binding of PPARgamma to Lpl. Of the known
      LPL-modulators, angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) showed the largest diurnal
      amplitude opposite to Lpl, and both Angptl4 knockout and overexpression
      attenuated oscillations of LPL activity and TG-derived FA-uptake by BAT.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight involvement of PPARgamma and a crucial role
      of ANGPTL4 in mediating the diurnal oscillation of TG-derived FA-uptake by BAT,
      and imply that time of day is essential when targeting LPL activity in BAT to
      improve metabolic health.

AB  - Bats rely on echolocation for operating in dim light or dark conditions.
      Accordingly, most research on echolocation is performed under dark conditions
      with a few exceptions. Bat species that emerge to forage before sunset have been 
      shown to use echolocation even in relatively high light levels(1-3). It has been 
      argued that for insectivorous bats, as light levels decrease, echolocation
      rapidly becomes advantageous over vision for detecting tiny insects during dusk
      or dawn(2) and that information from the two sensory modalities is
      integrated(4)(,)(5). Functional use of echolocation in broad daylight in
      insectivorous bats has been scarcely reported(6)(,)(7). Here, we report
      functional use of echolocation in broad daylight in highly visual fruit bats.

TI  - Bat selfies: photographic surveys of flying bats.
PG  - 1-17

AB  - The recent pandemic and other environmental concerns have resulted in
      restrictions on research and surveys involving capture and handling bats. While
      acoustic surveys have been widely used as an alternative survey method, in this
      study, we show how photographic surveys can offer an important contribution to
      study and survey bats. We outline approaches, using high speed flash and
      automated trip beams to obtain photos of flying bats of sufficient quality for
      reliable identification of species. We show, through a series of examples of
      setups and photographs, that photography is effective for surveying bats at a
      variety of sites, where bats roost, drink, and forage. We note, however, that
      photographic surveys cannot replace capture in all situations. In addition,
      although photographing bats is less invasive than capturing them, it can involve 
      disturbance, so we stress the importance of minimizing the impact of such
      operations on bats. Supplementary Information: The online version contains
      supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42991-022-00233-7.

AB  - Three betacoronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and established
      human-to-human transmission causing significant morbidity and mortality in the
      past 20 years. The most current and widespread of these is SARS-CoV-2. The
      identification of CoVs with zoonotic potential in animal reservoirs suggests that
      additional outbreaks could occur. Monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved
      neutralizing epitopes on diverse CoVs can form the basis for prophylaxis and
      therapeutic treatments and enable the design of vaccines aimed at providing
      pan-CoV protection. We previously identified a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 
      CV3-25 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Beta
      variant comparably to the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain, cross neutralizes
      SARS-CoV-1 and binds to recombinant proteins derived from the spike-ectodomains
      of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we show that the neutralizing activity of
      CV3-25 is maintained against the Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron variants of
      concern as well as a SARS-CoV-like bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential by
      binding to a conserved linear peptide in the stem-helix region. Negative stain
      electron microscopy and a 1.74 A crystal structure of a CV3-25/peptide complex
      demonstrates that CV3-25 binds to the base of the stem helix at the HR2 boundary 
      to an epitope that is distinct from other stem-helix directed neutralizing mAbs.

      compounds were isolated and identified in the same cultures. The most abundant
      product, the tetracyclic pimarane diterpene sphaeropsidin A, was tested for
      insecticidal effects against the model sucking aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum.
      Results showed a toxic dose-dependent oral activity of sphaeropsidin A, with an

TI  - The Occurrence of Skin Mites from the Demodecidae and Psorergatidae (Acariformes:

      Records.
LID - 875 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12070875 [doi]
AB  - The bat skin mites from the closely-related Demodecidae and Psorergatidae
      families occur synhospitally, populating the same host species and perhaps
      neighboring microhabitats. However, data on their occurrence and parasitism are
      fragmentary and dispersed. Thus far, 27 Demodecidae and 18 Psorergatidae species 
      have been described, but the coexistence of mites from both families was only
      demonstrated in six species of bats. This article presents a description of
      Demodex pusillus sp. nov. from Nyctalus noctula, including a new host record
      (first observation of demodecid mites in Nyctalus) and a new record concerning
      the occurrence of Psorergatoides kerivoluae in Plecotus auritus. It also includes
      an updated global checklist of the occurrence of Demodecidae and Psorergatidae in
      Chiroptera, including data on their records/distribution and location in their
      hosts. In both studied families, the mites exhibit preferences, and even
      topographic specificity, colonizing different microhabitats in the host,
      including the eye region (e.g., Meibomian glands of the eyes, corneal surface and
      eyelid vault), wing membranes and hairy skin on the body. Such colonization of
      separate microhabitats enables different species to co-occur within the same
      host, while the total number of parasites determines the level of parasite load, 
      with higher levels being associated with the incidence of disease symptoms. It is
      worth mentioning that Demodex pusillus sp. nov. is the smallest known
      representative of the Demodecidae family and one of the smallest animals (70-80
      micrometers in length).

      sarbecoviruses: A combined laboratory and computational network science approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronaviruses is widely distributed 
      throughout bats and other mammals globally and includes human pathogens, SARS-CoV
      and SARS-CoV-2. The most studied sarbecoviruses use the host protein, ACE2, to
      infect cells. Curiously, the majority of sarbecoviruses identified to date do not
      use ACE2 and cannot readily acquire ACE2 binding through point mutations. We
      previously screened a broad panel of sarbecovirus spikes for cell entry and
      observed bat-derived viruses that could infect human cells, independent of ACE2. 
      Here we further investigate the sequence determinants of cell entry for
      ACE2-independent bat sarbecoviruses. METHODS: We employed a network science-based
      approach to visualize sequence and entry phenotype similarities across the
      diversity of sarbecovirus spike protein sequences. We then verified these
      computational results and mapped determinants of viral entry into human cells
      using recombinant chimeric spike proteins within an established viral pseudotype 
      assay. FINDINGS: We show ACE2-independent viruses that can infect human and bat
      cells in culture have a similar putative receptor binding motif, which can impart
      human cell entry into other bat sarbecovirus spikes that cannot otherwise infect 
      human cells. These sequence determinants of human cell entry map to a
      surface-exposed protrusion from the predicted bat sarbecovirus spike receptor
      binding domain structure. INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide further evidence
      of a group of bat-derived sarbecoviruses with zoonotic potential and demonstrate 
      the utility in applying network science to phenotypic mapping and prediction.

TI  - Reducing persistent coronavirus infection in bats may lower the frequency of
      viral spillover to humans.
PG  - 402-408
LID - 10.3855/jidc.15627 [doi]
AB  - Coronaviruses have been responsible for the emergence of pathogenic human
      diseases in recent decades, especially the coronavirus disease of 2019
      (COVID-19). Phylogenetic studies of RNA (ribonucleic acid) viruses suggest that
      most human coronaviruses originated in bats, which are suitable reservoir hosts
      for many zoonotic viruses because of their unique biological and physiological
      features. The generation of human pathogenic coronaviruses is a result of genetic
      adaptation in bats and/or intermediate hosts, leading to spillover events.
      Therefore, we propose that specifically reducing or disrupting persistent
      coronavirus infection in bats may consequently decrease the frequency of human
      coronavirus diseases. We suggest several strategies to achieve the aforementioned
      goal in bats, including vaccination and targeted delivery of molecular
      inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies, aptamers, antisense oligonucleotides, 
      and siRNA by use of viral nanoparticles. Advances in global bat research with the
      aim of controlling coronavirus infection in these mammals are pivotal in
      enhancing human health worldwide.

TI  - Seroprevalence of IgG Antibodies Against Multiple Arboviruses in Bats from
      Cameroon, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
PG  - 252-262
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2021.0076 [doi]
AB  - Background: Emergence of mosquito-borne arboviruses has caused significant public
      health burden. The life cycle of arboviruses comprises sylvatic and urban cycles,
      including a wildlife reservoir, a human host, and an arthropod vector. However,
      many questions remain on the sylvatic cycles of arboviruses. In this study, we
      investigate the prevalence of IgG antibodies to arboviruses of public health
      importance in African bats. Material and Methods: We collected dried blood spots 
      from bats in Cameroon, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). To
      detect IgG antibodies to 10 antigens of 6 arboviruses (Dengue, Zika, West Nile,
      Usutu, Chikungunya, and O'nyong nyong viruses), we adapted a previously validated
      multiplex detection assay based on the Luminex technology. Results: We tested
      samples from 2579 bats, representing 1917 frugivorous and 641 insectivorous bats 
      distributed in 7 families and 21 species. Overall, 218/2579 (8.45%) bat samples
      reacted with at least 1 of the 10 antigens tested. The highest prevalence was
      observed against Usutu virus with 2.3% (59/2579), followed by 1.9% (49/2579) and 
      1.35% (35/2579) for the Dengue virus serotypes 4 and 3, respectively. The global 
      seroprevalence varied by country and collection site: 11% (151/1376) in Cameroon,
      3.5% (20/565) in DRC, and 7.3% (47/638) in Guinea. The highest rates were
      observed in Hypsignathus monstrosus (17.9%), Rousettus aegyptiacus (16.4%), and
      Eidolon helvum (10.7%), and in species from the insectivorous Molossidae family
      (7.8-8.9%). Finally, we observed changes in seroprevalence over the year in E.
      helvum and H. monstrosus colonies, which could be related to population
      structure. Conclusion: On more than 2500 bat samples tested, we showed variable
      IgG seroprevalences against multiple arboviruses. Overall, the prevalence of IgG 
      antibodies of 8.45% against arboviruses found in bats suggest that they could
      play a role in arboviruses cycles in the wild, in addition to other animal
      species.

      Relation to Metabolic-Endocrine Variables and Brown Adipose Tissue Activity.
PG  - 869581
LID - 10.3389/fped.2022.869581 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Bone morphogenetic protein-8B (BMP8B) is an adipokine produced by
      brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributing to thermoregulation and metabolic
      homeostasis in rodent models. In humans, BAT activity is particularly relevant in
      newborns and young infants. We assessed BMP8B levels and their relationship with 
      BAT activity and endocrine-metabolic parameters in young infants to ascertain its
      potentiality as biomarker in early life. Materials and Methods: BMP8B
      concentrations were assessed longitudinally by ELISA in a cohort of 27 girls and 
      23 boys at birth, and at age 4 and 12 months, together with adiposity parameters 
      (DXA), and circulating endocrine-metabolic variables. BAT activity was measured
      by infrared thermography. BMP8B gene expression (qRT-PCR) was determined in BAT, 
      white fat, and liver samples from neonatal necropsies, and in placenta and cord
      blood. Results: BMP8B levels were high at birth, particularly in boys (P = 0.04
      vs. girls), declined progressively, and remained well above those in healthy
      adults and pregnant women at age 1 year (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively).
      Neonatal BMP8B transcript levels were higher in BAT than in white fat, liver and 
      cord blood. Circulating BMP8B levels during the first year of life marginally
      correlated with bone mineral density and gains in lean mass. Conclusion: BMP8B
      levels are high at birth and decline progressively over the first year of life
      remaining above adult levels. Although changes in BMP8B concentrations overall
      reflect those in BAT activity during development, BMP8B levels are unlikely to be
      useful to predict individual variations in endocrine-metabolic status and BAT
      activity in healthy young infants.

AB  - Since its inception, cloud computing has greatly transformed our lives by
      connecting the entire world through shared computational resources over the
      internet. The COVID-19 pandemic has also disrupted the traditional learning and
      businesses and led us towards an era of cloud-based activities. Virtual machine
      is one of the main elements of virtualization in cloud computing that represents 
      physical server into the virtual machine. The utilizations of these VM's are
      important to achieved effective task scheduling mechanism in cloud environment.
      This paper focuses on improvment of the task distribution system in VM for cloud 
      computing using load balancing technique. For that reason modification took place
      at Bat algorithm fitness function value this section used in load balancer
      section. When algorithm iteration are complete then time to distribute the task
      among different VM therefore in this section of algorithm was modified. The
      second modification took place at the search process of Bat at dimension section.
      The proposed algorithm is known as modified Bat algorithm. Four parameter are
      used to check the performance of the system which are throughput, makespan,
      degree of imbalance and processing time. The proposed algorithm provides
      efficient result as compaire to other standard technique. Hence the proposed
      algorithm improved cloud data center accuracy and efficiency.

TI  - Weed Density Extraction Based on Few-Shot Learning Through UAV Remote Sensing RGB
      and Multispectral Images in Ecological Irrigation Area.
PG  - 735230
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2021.735230 [doi]
AB  - With the development of ecological irrigation area, a higher level of detection
      and control categories for weeds are currently required. In this article, an
      improved transfer neural network based on bionic optimization to detect weed
      density and crop growth is proposed, which used the pre-trained AlexNet network
      for transfer learning. Because the learning rate of the new addition layer is
      difficult to tune to the best, the weight and bias learning rate of the newly
      added fully connected layer is set with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bat
      algorithm (BA) to find the optimal combination on the small data set. Data are
      transported to the convolutional neural network (CNN) by collecting
      red-green-blue (RGB) and 5-band multispectral images of 3 kinds of weeds and 3
      kinds of crops as data sets, through cutting, rotating, and other operations.
      Finally, 6 kinds of classifications are implemented. At the same time, a
      self-constructed CNN based on model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is proposed in 
      order to realize the learning of neural networks with small sample and high
      efficiency, and its accuracy is verified in the test set. The neural networks
      optimized by two bionic optimization algorithms are compared with the
      self-constructed CNN based on MAML and histogram of oriented gradient + support
      vector machine (HOG + SVM). The experimental results show that the combination of
      learning rate through BA is the best, and its accuracy can reach 99.39% for RGB
      images, 99.53% for multispectral images, and 96.02% for a 6-shot small sample.
      The purpose of the classification proposed in this article is to calculate the
      growth of various plants (including weeds and crops) in the farmland. And various
      plant densities can be accurately calculated through the plant density
      calculation formula and algorithm proposed in this article, which provides a
      basis for the application of variable herbicides by experimenting in different
      farmlands. Finally, an excellent cycle of ecological irrigation district can be
      promoted.

AB  - Pioneering investigations on the effects of introduced populations on community
      structure, ecosystem functioning and services have focused on the effects of
      invaders on taxonomic diversity. However, taxonomic-based diversity metrics
      overlook the heterogeneity of species roles within and among communities. As the 
      homogenizing effects of biological invasions on community and ecosystem processes
      can be subtle, they may require the use of functional diversity indices to be
      properly evidenced. Starting from the listing of major functional diversity
      indices, alongside the presentation of their strengths and limitations, we focus 
      on studies pertaining to the effects of invasive species on native communities
      and recipient ecosystems using functional diversity indices. By doing so, we
      reveal that functional diversity of the recipient community may strongly vary at 
      the onset of the invasion process, while it stabilizes at intermediate and high
      levels of invasion. As functional changes occurring during the lag phase of an
      invasion have been poorly investigated, we show that it is still unknown whether 
      there are consistent changes in functional diversity metrics that could indicate 
      the end of the lag phase. Thus, we recommend providing information on the
      invasion stage under consideration when computing functional diversity metrics.
      For the existing literature, it is also surprising that very few studies explored
      the functional difference between organisms from the recipient communities and
      invaders of the same trophic levels, or assessed the effects of non-native
      organism establishment into a non-analogue versus an analogue community. By
      providing valuable tools for obtaining in-depth diagnostics of community
      structure and functioning, functional diversity indices can be applied for timely
      implementation of restoration plans and improved conservation strategies. To
      conclude, our work provides a first synthetic guide for their use in hypothesis
      testing in invasion biology.

AB  - AIMS: In mammals, heat stress (HS) from high-temperature environments has
      multiple adverse effects on the well-being of the organism. Brown adipose tissue 
      (BAT) is a thermogenesis tissue that protects against obesity, and as an
      endocrine organ that regulates the systemic metabolism, but it is unclear how
      heat stress affects BAT in normal and obese subjects. Understanding the
      transcriptomic profiles and lipidomics of BAT upon heat exposure provides
      insights into the adaptive changes associated with this process. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We constructed heat treatment (40 degrees C, 4 h) models for normal and 
      obese mice, observed the effect of heat treatment on interscapular BAT (iBAT) and
      performed an assay for iBAT with RNA-seq and lipidomics to compare
      transcriptional programs and lipid dynamics. KEY FINDINGS: In normal mice, heat
      treatment caused an iBAT damage by decreasing the expression of genes involved in
      thermogenesis, adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, HS disturbed the
      acyl-chain composition of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and glycerophospholipids (PEs, 
      PCs and CLs), accelerated the production of cholesterol esters, and caused the
      formation of giant lipid droplets rich in cholesterol esters in iBAT.
      Unexpectedly, in obese mice, heat treatment had a smaller effect on iBAT by
      improving the composition of the saturated glycerolipids, PEs and PCs and
      increasing the proportion of oxidized lipid in lipid droplets. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      findings proved lipid droplets participated in the regulation of lipid components
      of iBAT in normal and obese mice after heat treatment, which provided a new view 
      for the understanding of the adaptation of iBAT to high-temperature environments.

AB  - By disrupting nocturnal landscapes worldwide, light pollution caused by
      Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) is recognized as a major threat to biodiversity.
      As even low light intensities might affect some taxa, concerns are arising about 
      biological responses to widespread low light levels. We used data from a French
      citizen science bat monitoring program (1894 full-nights monitored on 1055 sites)
      to explore the landscape-scale effects of light on an open-space-foraging bat
      species, the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus). We assessed this species'
      abundance and timing of night-time activity (median time of activity) at foraging
      sites. ALAN, and to a lesser extent moonlight, reduced E. serotinus abundance.
      ALAN delayed activity, and this delay was amplified during overcast nights. On
      the contrary, where there was no ALAN, the higher the cloud cover, the earlier
      the activity occurred. Cloud cover likely darkened the night sky in rural
      locations, whereas it amplified skyglow in light-polluted places, increasing ALAN
      effects on bats. Interestingly, moonlight also delayed activity but this effect
      was weakened where there was ALAN. Our study shows that even fine variations of
      light levels could affect the spatiotemporal distribution of a common species
      usually considered to be "light tolerant", with potential cascading effects on
      individual fitness and population dynamics. It stresses how urgent it is to
      preserve and restore dark areas to protect biodiversity from light pollution
      while working on light intensity and directivity where ALAN is needed.

TI  - Phenylhydrazine-induced anaemia reduces subcutaneous white and brown adipose
      tissues in hypothalamic obese rats.
PG  - 575-588
LID - 10.1113/EP089883 [doi]
AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Can an anaemic state
      modify adiposity and metabolic parameters in hypothalamic obese rats? What is the
      main finding and its importance? Hypothalamic obese rats do not display iron
      deficiency. However, the pharmacological induction of anaemia in hypothalamic
      obese rats resulted in reduced adiposity, characterized by a decrease in
      subcutaneous white and brown adipose tissue depots. These findings suggest that
      iron imbalance in obesity may elevate lipolysis. ABSTRACT: Iron imbalance is
      frequent in obesity. Herein, we evaluated the impact of anaemia induced by
      phenylhydrazine on adiposity and metabolic state of hypothalamic obese rats.
      Hypothalamic obesity was induced by high doses of monosodium glutamate (MSG; 4
      g/kg) administered to neonatal male rats (n = 20). Controls (CTL; non-obese rats)
      received equimolar saline (n = 20). Rats were weaned at 21 days of life. At 70
      days, half of the rats received three intraperitoneal doses of phenylhydrazine
      (PHZ; 40 mg/kg/dose) or saline solution. Body weight and food intake were
      followed for 4 weeks after PHZ administration. At 92 days, rats were killed and
      blood was collected for microcapillary haematocrit (Hct) analysis and plasma
      quantification of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol and iron levels. The 
      liver, the spleen, and the white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues were
      excised, weighed and used for histology. MSG-treated rats developed obesity,
      hypertriglyceridaemia and insulin resistance, compared to CTL rats, without
      changes in iron levels and Hct. PHZ administration reduced plasma iron levels and
      promoted similar tissue injuries in the spleen and liver from MSG and CTL rats.
      However, in MSG-treated rats, PHZ decreased fasting glucose levels and Hct, as
      well as diminishing the subcutaneous WAT and BAT mass. Although MSG-obesity does 
      not affect plasma iron levels and Hct by itself, PHZ-induced anaemia associated
      with obesity induces a marked drop in subcutaneous WAT and BAT mass, suggesting
      that iron imbalance may lead to increased lipolytic responses in obese rats,
      compared to lean rats.

TI  - Efficacy and cost of acoustic-informed and wind speed-only turbine curtailment to
      reduce bat fatalities at a wind energy facility in Wisconsin.
PG  - e0266500
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0266500 [doi]
AB  - Current research estimates hundreds of thousands of turbine-related bat
      fatalities in North America annually. In an effort to reduce impacts of wind
      energy production on bat populations, many facilities implement operational
      curtailment strategies that limit turbine blade rotation during conditions when
      nighttime wind speeds are low. Incorporating real-time bat activity data into
      wind speed-only curtailment (WOC) strategies may increase operational flexibility
      by allowing turbines to operate normally when bats are not present near turbines.
      We evaluated costs and benefits of implementing the Turbine Integrated Mortality 
      Reduction (TIMR) system, an approach that informs a curtailment-triggering
      algorithm based on wind speed and real-time bat acoustic data, compared to a WOC 
      strategy in which turbines were curtailed below 4.5 meters per second (m/s) at a 
      wind energy facility in Fond Du Lac County, Wisconsin. TIMR is a proprietary
      system and we had no access to the acoustic data or bat call analysis software.
      Operational parameters for the TIMR system were set to allow curtailment at all
      wind speeds below 8.0 m/s during the study period when bats were acoustically
      detected. Overall, the TIMR system reduced fatalities by 75% compared to control 
      turbines, while the WOC strategy reduced fatalities by 47%. An earlier analysis
      of the same TIMR data neglected to account for carcasses occurring outside the
      plot boundary and estimated an 84.5% fatality reduction due to the TIMR system.
      Over the study period, bat activity led to curtailment of TIMR turbines during
      39.4% of nighttime hours compared to 31.0% of nighttime hours for WOC turbines,
      and revenue losses were approximately 280% as great for TIMR turbines as for
      turbines operated under the WOC strategy. The large cost difference between WOC
      and TIMR was driven by the 4.5 m/s versus 8.0 m/s wind speed thresholds for
      curtailment, but our study site has a relatively low average wind speed, which
      may also have contributed; other wind operators considering the TIMR system will 
      need to consider their ability to absorb production losses in relation to their
      need to reduce bat fatality rates.

TI  - Characterization of spatiotemporal electroactive anodic biofilm activity
      distribution using 1D simulations.
PG  - 5849
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-09596-w [doi]
AB  - Activity distribution limitation in electroactive biofilm remains an unclear
      phenomenon. Some observations using confocal microscopy have shown notable
      difference between activity close to the anode and activity at the liquid
      interface. A numerical model is developed in this work to describe biofilm growth
      and local biomass segregation in electroactive biofilm. Under our model
      hypothesis, metabolic activity distribution in the biofilm results from the
      competition between two limiting factors: acetate diffusion and electronic
      conduction in the biofilm. Influence of inactive biomass fraction (i.e.
      non-growing biomass fraction) properties (such as conductivity and density) is
      simulated to show variation in local biomass distribution. Introducing a
      dependence of effective diffusion to local density leads to a drastic biomass
      fraction segregation. Increasing density of inactive fraction reduces
      significantly acetate diffusion in biofilm, enhances biomass activity on the
      outer layer (liquid/biofilm interface) and maintains inner core largely inactive.
      High inactive fraction conductivity enhances biomass activity in the outer layer 
      and enhances current production. Hence, investment in extracellular polymer
      substance (EPS), anchoring redox components, is benefit for biofilm
      electroactivity. However, under our model hypothesis it means that conductivity
      should be two order lower than biofilm conductivity reported in order to observe 
      inner core active biomass segregation.

TI  - Brown adipose tissue: a protective mechanism in "pre-prediabetes"?
LID - jnumed.121.263357 [pii]
LID - 10.2967/jnumed.121.263357 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is present in a significant number of adult humans and
      has been postulated to exert beneficial metabolic effects. Lean, non-diabetic
      patients undergoing clinical positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) imaging are more likely to exhibit incidental BAT activation. The
      aim of this study was to assess metabolic changes associated with the
      cold-activation of BAT and to compare baseline blood metabolites in participants 
      with varying amounts of active BAT. Methods: Serum blood samples were collected
      from healthy adult volunteers (body mass index 18.0-25.0 and age</=35 years)
      before and after 2 h cold exposure. (18)F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT imaging 
      was performed immediately following cold exposure. Activated BAT was segmented
      and fasting glucose, insulin, lipid, and other blood metabolite levels were
      correlated with volume and intensity of active BAT. Using a median cutoff,
      subjects were classified as BATHIGH or BATLOW. Results: A higher volume of
      activated BAT was associated with significantly higher pre-cooling glucose and
      insulin levels (P<0.001 for each). Pre-cooling thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
      and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the BATHIGH than in the
      BATLOW group (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). Triglyceride levels tended to
      increase over the cooling period in both BAT groups, but increased significantly 
      more in the BATHIGH group (15.7+/-13.2 md/dl; P<0.001) than in the BATLOW group
      (4.5+/-12.2 mg/dl; P = 0.061). Conclusion: These findings may indicate that BAT
      is recruited to counteract incipient "pre-prediabetic" states, potentially
      serving as a first-line protective mechanism against very early metabolic or
      hormonal variations.

TI  - Methods for assessing artificial thermal refuges: Spatiotemporal analysis more
      informative than averages.

AB  - 1: Thermal refuges are widely used by animals of all taxonomic groups and are
      critical to survival in severe weather. 2: Human activities are reducing the
      availability of natural refuges; consequently, artificial refuges are used as
      conservation management tools, particularly for bats. 3: Published box
      evaluations are generally incomplete, omitting thermal physiology and relevant
      thermal properties. 4: Here, we compare methods for evaluating the potential
      utility of bat box designs for bats and present a graphical spatiotemporal method
      that provides more complete information. 5: For illustration, we compare the
      original to three modified versions of the "rocket box" style bat box. 6: Box
      internal temperatures and generalized thermal physiology models are combined in
      two suitability indices appropriate to the mother, and to pups. 7: Results
      revealed that daily and seasonal averages of these indices obscured important
      processes and showed insignificant differences among bat box design
      modifications. 8: In contrast, graphical analysis highlighted the presence and
      spatiotemporal structure of significant differences among boxes, which were most 
      evident in sunny weather. 9: Differences among boxes were sensitive to
      assumptions about bat thermal physiology and behavior. 10: We found that an
      external water jacket mitigated temperature extremes and extended favorable
      temperatures into the night, which could enhance pup development while the
      mothers foraged. 11: Further experiments are needed to evaluate the relation
      between metabolic heating by box occupants and thermal conditions within bat
      boxes.

AB  - Heavy metals represent a serious issue regarding both environmental and health
      status. Their monitoring is necessary and it is necessary the development of
      decentralized approaches that are able to enforce the risk assessment.
      Electrochemical sensors and biosensors, with the various architectures, represent
      a solid reality often involved for this type of analytical determination.
      Although these approaches offer easy-to-use and portable tools, some limitations 
      are often highlighted in presence of multi-targets and/or real matrices. However,
      chemometrics- and artificial intelligence-based tools, both for designing and for
      data analyzing, display the capability in producing novel functionality towards
      the management of complex matrices which often contain more information than
      those that are visualized with sensor detection. Design of experiment,
      exploratory, predictive and regression analysis can push the world of
      electrochemical (bio)sensors beyond the state of the art, because is still too
      large the number of analytical chemists that do not deal with multivariate
      thinking. In this paper, the use of multivariate methods applied to

AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is one of the priority pathogens with pandemic potential.
      Though the spread is far slower than SARS-CoV-2, case fatality is the biggest
      concern. Fruit bats belonging to genus Pteropus are identified to be the main
      reservoir of the virus causing sporadic cases and outbreaks in Malaysia,
      Bangladesh and India. The sudden emergence of Nipah in Kerala, India during
      2018-2019 has been astonishing with respect to its introduction in the unaffected
      areas. With this, active Nipah virus surveillance was conducted among bat
      populations in Southern part of India viz., Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu,
      Telangana, Puducherry and Odisha during January-November 2019. Throat
      swabs/rectal swabs (n = 573) collected from Pteropus medius and Rousettus
      leschenaultii bat species and sera of Pteropus medius bats (n = 255) were
      screened to detect the presence of Nipah viral RNA and anti-Nipah IgG antibodies 
      respectively. Of 255 P. medius bats sera samples, 51 bats (20%) captured from
      Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry demonstrated presence of anti-Nipah 
      IgG antibodies. However, the presence of virus couldn't be detected in any of the
      bat specimens. The recent emergence of Nipah virus in Kerala in September 2021
      warrants further surveillance of Nipah virus among bat populations from the
      affected and remaining states of India.

      Japanese infants and children.
PG  - 190-198
LID - 10.1002/osp4.559 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objective: The importance of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is well
      recognized in healthy infants and children. However, information regarding
      age-related changes in BAT vascular density (BAT-d) and the impact of BAT-d on
      body adiposity are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the normal values of
      BAT-d, factors influencing BAT-d, and the impact of BAT-d on body adiposity in
      healthy infants and children. Methods: This study included 240 participants (127 
      girls and 113 boys) aged 1 month to 5 years. The tissue total hemoglobin
      concentration in the supraclavicular region adjusted according to the
      subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (SAT) ([total-Hb-Adj]sup) as BAT-d. SAT in 
      the deltoid and interscapular regions (SATdel+int), the Kaup index (body weight
      [g]/height or length [cm]/height or length [cm] x 10) as body adiposity, and
      fertilization season were also measured. Results: The [total-Hb-Adj]sup of boys
      was higher than that of girls (r = 0.277, p = 0.009). Younger children had a
      significantly higher Kaup index (r = 0.495, p < 0.001) and SATdel+int (r = 0.614,
      p < 0.001) than older children. Children who had higher [total-Hb-Adj]sup had a
      significantly lower Kaup index (r = 0.495, p = 0.037) and SATdel+int (r = 0.614, 
      p < 0.001). Conclusion: The [total-Hb-Adj]sup, as a parameter of BAT-d, is
      negatively correlated with body adiposity in children aged 1 month to 5 years,
      and BAT might affect human obesity to a much greater extent than expected. To
      prevent or treat obesity in early childhood, the level of BAT-d should be
      considered when using a dietary intervention.

TI  - Small Extracellular Vesicles From Brown Adipose Tissue Mediate Exercise
      Cardioprotection.
PG  - 1490-1506
LID - 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.320458 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Long-term exercise provides reliable cardioprotection via mechanisms
      still incompletely understood. Although traditionally considered a thermogenic
      tissue, brown adipose tissue (BAT) communicates with remote organs (eg, the
      heart) through its endocrine function. BAT expands in response to exercise, but
      its involvement in exercise cardioprotection remains undefined. OBJECTIVE: This
      study investigated whether small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) secreted by BAT
      and their contained microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate cardiomyocyte survival and
      participate in exercise cardioprotection in the context of myocardial
      ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four weeks of exercise
      resulted in a significant BAT expansion in mice. Surgical BAT ablation before
      MI/R weakened the salutary effects of exercise. Adeno-associated virus 9 vectors 
      carrying short hairpin RNA targeting Rab27a (a GTPase required for sEV secretion)
      or control viruses were injected in situ into the interscapular BAT.
      Exercise-mediated protection against MI/R injury was greatly attenuated in mice
      whose BAT sEV secretion was suppressed by Rab27a silencing. Intramyocardial
      injection of the BAT sEVs ameliorated MI/R injury, revealing the cardioprotective
      potential of BAT sEVs. Discovery-driven experiments identified miR-125b-5p,
      miR-128-3p, and miR-30d-5p (referred to as the BAT miRNAs) as essential BAT sEV
      components for mediating cardioprotection. BAT-specific inhibition of the BAT
      miRNAs prevented their upregulation in plasma sEVs and hearts of exercised mice
      and attenuated exercise cardioprotection. Mechanistically, the BAT miRNAs
      cooperatively suppressed the proapoptotic MAPK (mitogen-associated protein
      kinase) pathway by targeting a series of molecules (eg, Map3k5, Map2k7, and
      Map2k4) in the signaling cascade. Delivery of BAT sEVs into hearts or
      cardiomyocytes suppressed MI/R-related MAPK pathway activation, an effect that
      disappeared with the combined use of the BAT miRNA inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The
      sEVs secreted by BAT participate in exercise cardioprotection via delivering the 
      cardioprotective miRNAs into the heart. These results provide novel insights into
      the mechanisms underlying the BAT-cardiomyocyte interaction and highlight BAT
      sEVs and their contained miRNAs as alternative candidates for exercise
      cardioprotection.

LID - 10.3389/falgy.2021.721851 [doi]
AB  - Allergic mechanisms account for most cases of chronic rhinitis. This condition is
      associated with significant impairment of quality of life and high indirect
      costs. The identification of the allergic triggers of rhinitis has been
      historically based on the performance of atopy test [skin prick test (SPT) and
      serum allergen-specific (s)IgE]. Nevertheless, these tests only denote
      sensitization, and atopy and allergy represent two different phenomena. It is now
      clear that allergic phenotypes of rhinitis can exist in both atopic (allergic
      rhinitis, AR) and non-atopic (local allergic rhinitis, LAR) individuals.
      Moreover, both allergic phenotypes can coexist in the same rhinitis patient (dual
      allergic rhinitis, DAR). Therefore, a diagnostic approach merely based on atopy
      tests is associated with a significant rate of misdiagnosis. The confirmation of 
      the allergic etiology of rhinitis requires the performance of in vivo test like
      the nasal allergen challenge (NAC). NAC is mandatory for the diagnosis of LAR and
      DAR, and helps decide the best management approach in difficult cases of AR.
      Nevertheless, NAC is a laborious technique requiring human and technical
      resources. The basophil activation test (BAT) is a patient-friendly technique
      that has shown promising results for LAR and DAR diagnosis. In this review, the
      diagnostic usefulness for chronic rhinitis of SPT, NAC, olfactory tests, serum
      sIgE, BAT and the quantification of inflammatory mediators in nasal samples will 
      be discussed. The accurate performance of an etiologic diagnosis of rhinitis
      patients will favor the prescription of specific therapies with disease-modifying
      potential like allergen immunotherapy.

TI  - Effectiveness of acoustic lures for increasing tropical forest understory bat
      captures.
PG  - e8775
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8775 [doi]
AB  - Bats are the most diverse mammalian order second to rodents, with 1400+ species
      globally. In the tropics, it is possible to find more than 60 bat species at a
      single site. However, monitoring bats is challenging due to their small size,
      ability to fly, cryptic nature, and nocturnal activity. Recently, bioacoustic
      techniques have been incorporated into survey methods, either through passive
      acoustic monitoring or acoustic bat lures. Lures have been developed on the
      premise that broadcasting acoustic stimuli increases the number of captures in
      harp traps or mist nets. However, this is a relatively new, niche method. This
      study tested the efficacy of two commonly used acoustic bat lure devices,
      broadcasting two different acoustic stimuli, to increase forest understory bat
      captures in the tropics. This is the first time an acoustic bat lure has been
      systematically tested in a tropical rainforest, and the first study to compare
      two lure devices (Sussex AutoBat and Apodemus BatLure). Using a paired
      experimental design, two synthesized acoustic stimuli were broadcasted, a feeding
      call and a social call, to understand the importance of the call type used on
      capture rates and genus-specific responses. Using an acoustic lure significantly 
      increased capture rates, while the type of device did not impact capture rates.
      The two acoustic stimuli had an almost even distribution of captures, suggesting 
      that the type of call may be less important than previously thought. Results
      indicate a possible deterrent effect on Rhinolophous sp., while being
      particularly effective for attracting bats in the genera Murina and Kerivoula.
      This study highlights the effectiveness of lures, however, also indicates that
      lure effects can vary across genera. Therefore, lures may bias survey results by 
      altering the species composition of bats caught. Future research should focus on 
      a single species or genus, using synthesized calls of conspecifics, to fully
      understand the effect of lures.

      Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis.
PG  - 822554
LID - 10.3389/falgy.2022.822554 [doi]
AB  - Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) is a cofactor-induced wheat 
      allergy. Gluten proteins, especially omega5-gliadins, are known as major
      allergens, but partially hydrolyzed wheat proteins (HWPs) also play a role. Our
      study investigated the link between the molecular composition of gluten or HWP
      and allergenicity. Saline extracts of gluten (G), gluten with reduced content of 
      omega5-gliadins (G-omega5), slightly treated HWPs (sHWPs), and extensively
      treated HWPs (eHWPs) were prepared as allergen test solutions and their
      allergenicity assessed using the skin prick test and basophil activation test
      (BAT) on twelve patients with WDEIA and ten controls. Complementary sodium
      dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), high-performance
      liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses revealed that
      non-gluten proteins, mainly alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), were
      predominant in the allergen test solutions of G, G-omega5, and sHWPs. Only eHWPs 
      contained gliadins and glutenins as major fraction. All allergen test solutions
      induced significantly higher %CD63(+) basophils/anti-FcepsilonRI ratios in
      patients compared with controls. BAT using sHWPs yielded 100% sensitivity and 83%
      specificity at optimal cut-off and may be useful as another tool in WDEIA
      diagnosis. Our findings indicate that non-gluten proteins carrying yet
      unidentified allergenic epitopes appear to be relevant in WDEIA. Further research
      is needed to clarify the role of nutritional ATIs in WDEIA and identify specific 
      mechanisms of immune activation.

TI  - Tyrosol Ameliorates the Symptoms of Obesity, Promotes Adipose Thermogenesis, and 
      Modulates the Composition of Gut Microbiota in HFD Fed Mice.
PG  - e2101015
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.202101015 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Tyrosol is one of the main polyphenolic compounds in extra virgin olive
      oil (EVOO) and its role in combating obesity is unknown. Thus, this study is
      designed to investigate the effect of tyrosol consumption on obesity and its
      underlying mechanisms in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      After supplementation with 0.2% (wt/wt) tyrosol for 16 weeks, the final body
      weight, and the levels of plasma triacylglycerol (TG), total cholesterol (TC),
      and fasting glucose are significantly decreased when compared with HFD group.
      Furthermore, tyrosol may act as a ligand which binds with nuclear hormone
      receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Uncoupling
      protein 1 (UCP1), iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (DIO2), PPAR-gamma
      coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), and PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), the
      downstream genes of PPARalpha which are related to thermogenic function of
      adipocytes, are significantly increased in both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and
      inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) after tyrosol administration. In addition,
      tyrosol changes the community composition of gut microbiota, including decreasing
      the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increasing the relative abundance
      of family muribaculaceae, genus Blautia and Lachnospiraceae_bacterium_28_4.
      CONCLUSION: Tyrosol consumption attenuates obesity and related symptoms in
      HFD-fed mice probably via the modulation of PPARalpha-thermogenesis and gut
      microbiota.

AB  - Studies examining the overwintering behaviors of North American hibernating bats 
      are limited to a handful of species. We deployed temperature-sensitive
      transmitters on four species of bat that exhibit differences in their
      susceptibility to white nose syndrome (WNS; Myotis grisescens, M. leibii, M.
      sodalis, and Perimyotis subflavus) to determine if these differences are
      correlated with behavior exhibited during hibernation (i.e., torpor expression
      and arousal frequency). Mean torpor skin temperature (Tsk) and torpor bout
      duration varied significantly among species (P </= 0.024), but arousal Tsk and
      duration did not (P >/= 0.057). One of the species with low susceptibility to
      WNS, M. leibii, had significantly shorter torpor bout durations (37.67 +/- 26.89 
      h) than M. sodalis (260.67 +/- 41.33 h), the species with medium susceptibility
      to WNS. Myotis leibii also had significantly higher torpor Tsk (18.57 degrees C
      +/- 0.20) than M. grisescens (13.33 degrees C +/- 0.60), a second species with
      low WNS susceptibility. The high susceptibility species, Perimyotis subflavus,
      exhibited low torpor Tsk (14.42 degrees C +/- 0.36) but short torpor bouts (72.36
      +/- 32.16 h). We demonstrate that the four cavernicolous species examined exhibit
      a wide range in torpid skin temperature and torpor bout duration. Information
      from this study may improve WNS management in multispecies hibernacula or
      individual species management by providing insight into how some species may
      differ in their techniques for overwinter survival.

AB  - Understanding biodiversity patterns as well as drivers of population declines,
      and range losses provides crucial baselines for monitoring and conservation.
      However, the information needed to evaluate such trends remains unstandardised
      and sparsely available for many taxonomic groups and habitats, including the
      cave-dwelling bats and cave ecosystems. We developed the DarkCideS 1.0 (
      https://darkcides.org/ ), a global database of bat caves and species synthesised 
      from publicly available information and datasets. The DarkCideS 1.0 is by far the
      largest database for cave-dwelling bats, which contains information for
      geographical location, ecological status, species traits, and parasites and
      hyperparasites for 679 bat species are known to occur in caves or use caves in
      part of their life histories. The database currently contains 6746 georeferenced 
      occurrences for 402 cave-dwelling bat species from 2002 cave sites in 46
      countries and 12 terrestrial biomes. The database has been developed to be
      collaborative and open-access, allowing continuous data-sharing among the
      community of bat researchers and conservation biologists to advance bat research 
      and comparative monitoring and prioritisation for conservation.

AB  - Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) is a major antiviral drug target and has
      recently reemerged as a key target of antibody-mediated protective immunity. Here
      we show that recombinant NAs across non-bat subtypes adopt various tetrameric
      conformations, including an "open" state that may help explain poorly understood 
      variations in NA stability across viral strains and subtypes. We use
      homology-directed protein design to uncover the structural principles underlying 
      these distinct tetrameric conformations and stabilize multiple recombinant NAs in
      the "closed" state, yielding two near-atomic resolution structures of NA by
      cryo-EM. In addition to enhancing thermal stability, conformational stabilization
      improves affinity to protective antibodies elicited by viral infection, including
      antibodies targeting a quaternary epitope and the broadly conserved catalytic
      site. Stabilized NAs can also be integrated into viruses without affecting
      fitness. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of NA structure, stability, 
      and antigenicity, and establish design strategies for reinforcing the
      conformational integrity of recombinant NA proteins.

AB  - 3-Acetylisoxazolines were synthesized by the reaction of natural (R)-limonene and
      (R)-carvone with acetone in the presence of iron (III) nitrate. The reaction
      showed to be highly peri- and regioselective. Next, using a 1,3-dipolar
      cycloaddition reaction, the mono-3-acylisoxazolines derived from these
      monoterpenes were evaluated for their reactivity with nitrilimines. Only the
      enone of carvone-isoxazoline was regioselectively reactive, providing a new fused
      isoxazoline-carvone-pyrazolines. The structure of all the newly synthesized
      mono-cycloadducts (3 & 5) and bis-cycloadducts (4 & 7a-c) were fully identified
      based on their HRMS and NMR spectral data. They have also been screened for their
      cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines: fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), 
      lung carcinoma (A-549), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) cell lines. The
      obtained results showed that compound 4 was a potent cytotoxic agent against all 
      selected cells. The possible mechanism of apoptosis induction by compound 4 was
      investigated using Annexin-V binding assay, caspase-3/7 activity and analysis
      cell cycle progression. The compound 4 induced the early apoptosis of both MCF-7 
      and MDA-MB-231 through caspase-3/7 activation, and the compound 4 have elicited S
      and G2/M phase arrest in MCF-7and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, respectively. For
      further target investigations, a molecular docking study was employed and it
      showed that compound 4 has an inhibitory activity against Pim-1 protein kinase.
      Molecular dynamics study showed that compound 4/Pim-1 complex was stable during
      the simulation run at different time intervals. In-Silico ADMET predicted that
      compound 4 has good pharmacokinetic properties with high estimated oral
      bioavailability.

AB  - The spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum), the largest bat species in the Americas, is
      considered Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
      and is listed as a species of special concern or endangered in several countries 
      throughout its range. Although the species is known as carnivorous, data on basic
      ecology, including habitat selection and primary diet items, are limited owing to
      its relative rarity and difficulty in capturing the species. Leveraging advances 
      in DNA metabarcoding and using radio-telemetry, we present novel information on
      the diet and movement of V. spectrum based on locations of a radio-collared
      individual and fecal samples collected from its communal roost (three
      individuals) in the Lowland Dry Forest of southern Nicaragua. Using a
      non-invasive approach, we explored the diet of the species with genetic markers
      designed to capture a range of arthropods and vertebrate targets from fecal
      samples. We identified 27 species of vertebrate prey which included birds,
      rodents, and other bat species. Our evidence suggested that V. spectrum can
      forage on a variety of species, from those associated with mature forests to
      forest edge-dwellers. Characteristics of the roost and our telemetry data
      underscore the importance of large trees for roosting in mature forest patches
      for the species. These data can inform conservation efforts for preserving both
      the habitat and the prey items in remnants of mature forest required by Vampyrum 
      spectrum to survive in landscape mosaics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome (ATOS) is rare. We present our
      30-year experience with the management of ATOS at a high-volume referral center. 
      METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who had undergone primary
      operative treatment for ATOS from 1988 to 2018 was performed. ATOS was defined as
      subclavian artery pathology caused by extrinsic compression from a bony
      abnormality within the thoracic outlet. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients (45
      limbs) underwent surgery for ATOS at a median age of 46 years (interquartile
      range [IQR], 34-58 years). Chronic symptoms (>6 weeks) were present in 31 limbs
      (69%). Of the 45 limbs, 13 (29%) presented with acute limb ischemia (ALI),
      requiring urgent brachial artery thromboembolectomy (BAT) in 9 and
      catheter-directed thrombolysis and thrombectomy (CDT) in 4. All patients
      underwent thoracic outlet decompression. 31 limbs (69%) required subclavian
      artery reconstruction. No perioperative deaths and only one major adverse limb
      event occurred. Patients with ALI underwent staged thoracic outlet decompression 
      after initial BAT or CDT at a median of 23 days (IQR, 11-140 days). Of the 13
      limbs with an initial presentation of ALI, 8 (62%) had recurrent thromboembolic
      events before thoracic outlet decompression subsequently requiring 10 additional 
      BATs and 1 CDT. The cumulative probability of recurrent embolization at 14, 30,
      and 90 days was 8.33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28%-54.42%), 16.67% (95%
      CI, 4.70%-59.06%), and 33.33% (95% CI, 14.98-74.20%), respectively. The median
      follow-up for 32 patients (35 limbs) was 13 months (IQR, 5-36 months). Subclavian
      artery/graft primary and secondary patency was 87% and 90%, respectively, at 5
      years by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of the 35 limbs, 5 (14%) had chronic upper
      extremity pain and 5 (14%) had persistent weakness. Preoperative forearm or hand 
      pain and brachial artery occlusion were associated with chronic pain (P = .04 and
      P = .03) and weakness (P = .03 and P = .02). Of the 13 limbs that presented with 
      ALI, 11 had a median follow-up after thoracic outlet decompression of 6 months
      (IQR, 5-14 months), including 9 (82%) with oral anticoagulation therapy.
      Anticoagulation therapy had no effect on subclavian artery patency (P = 1.0) or
      the presence of chronic symptoms (P = .93). CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of ATOS
      is diverse, and the diagnosis can be delayed. Preoperative upper extremity pain
      and brachial artery occlusion in the setting of ALI were associated with chronic 
      pain and weakness after thoracic outlet decompression. Delayed thoracic outlet
      decompression was associated with an increased risk of recurrent thromboembolic
      events for patients who presented with ALI. An early and accurate diagnosis of
      ATOS is necessary to reduce morbidity and optimize outcomes.

AB  - In Southern Italy, since 2013, there has been an ongoing Olive Quick Decline
      Syndrome (OQDS) outbreak, due to the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which has
      caused a dramatic impact from both socio-economic and environmental points of
      view. The main players involved in OQDS are represented by the insect vector,
      Philaenus spumarius, its host plants (olive trees and weeds) and the bacterium,
      X. fastidiosa. Current agronomic practices are mainly based on uprooting the sick
      olive trees and their surrounding ones, with later installment of olive cultivars
      more resistant to the bacterium infection. Unfortunately, both of these practices
      are having an undesirable impact on the environment (most of these olive trees
      were monumental ones) and on the economy. Based on a mathematical model expressed
      in terms of a nontrivial system of ordinary differential equations, our analysis 
      has provided a clear picture of all possible steady states (feasible equilibria) 
      and their stability properties, corresponding to a variety of different parameter
      scenarios; all of this has been illustrated by a set of computational
      experiments. A significant original contribution of this paper is the proof of
      the global asymptotic stability of each of the feasible equilibria under its
      existence assumptions, a fact that excludes multiple equilibria under the given
      conditions. It has emerged that the removal of a suitable amount of weed biomass 
      (host plants of the juvenile stages of the insect vector of X. fastidiosa) from
      olive orchards and surrounding areas leads to the eradication of the epidemic,
      without requiring neither the removal nor the substitution of the existing olive 
      trees.

AB  - Body size and shape fundamentally determine organismal energy requirements by
      modulating heat and mass exchange with the environment and the costs of
      locomotion, thermoregulation, and maintenance. Ecologists have long used the
      physical linkage between morphology and energy balance to explain why the body
      size and shape of many organisms vary across climatic gradients, e.g., why larger
      endotherms are more common in colder regions. However, few modeling exercises
      have aimed at investigating this link from first principles. Body size evolution 
      in bats contrasts with the patterns observed in other endotherms, probably
      because physical constraints on flight limit morphological adaptations. Here, we 
      develop a biophysical model based on heat transfer and aerodynamic principles to 
      investigate energy constraints on morphological evolution in bats. Our
      biophysical model predicts that the energy costs of thermoregulation and flight, 
      respectively, impose upper and lower limits on the relationship of wing surface
      area to body mass (S-MR), giving rise to an optimal S-MR at which both energy
      costs are minimized. A comparative analysis of 278 species of bats supports the
      model's prediction that S-MR evolves toward an optimal shape and that the
      strength of selection is higher among species experiencing greater energy demands
      for thermoregulation in cold climates. Our study suggests that energy costs
      modulate the mode of morphological evolution in bats-hence shedding light on a
      long-standing debate over bats' conformity to ecogeographical patterns observed
      in other mammals-and offers a procedure for investigating complex macroecological
      patterns from first principles.

AB  - Much of the fascination of the Wilms tumor protein (WT1) emanates from its unique
      roles in development and disease. Ubiquitous Wt1 deletion in adult mice causes
      multiple organ failure including a reduction of body fat. WT1 is expressed in fat
      cell progenitors in visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) but detected neither in
      energy storing subcutaneous WAT nor in heat producing brown adipose tissue (BAT).
      Our recent findings indicate that WT1 represses thermogenic genes and maintains
      the white adipose identity of visceral fat. Wt1 heterozygosity in mice is
      associated with molecular and morphological signs of browning including elevated 
      levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in epididymal WAT. Compared to their
      wild-type littermates, Wt1 heterozygous mice exhibit significantly improved
      whole-body glucose tolerance and alleviated hepatic steatosis under high-fat
      diet. Partial protection of heterozygous Wt1 knockout mice against metabolic
      dysfunction is presumably related to browning of their epididymal WAT. In the
      light of recent advancements, this article reviews the role of WT1 in the
      development of visceral WAT and its supposed function as a regulator of white
      adipose identity.

TI  - Hybrid Hypercube Optimization Search Algorithm and Multilayer Perceptron Neural
      Network for Medical Data Classification.
PG  - 1612468
LID - 10.1155/2022/1612468 [doi]
AB  - The hypercube optimization search (HOS) approach is a new efficient and robust
      metaheuristic algorithm that simulates the dove's movement in quest of new food
      sites in nature, utilizing hypercubes to depict the search zones. In medical
      informatics, the classification of medical data is one of the most challenging
      tasks because of the uncertainty and nature of healthcare data. This paper
      proposes the use of the HOS algorithm for training multilayer perceptrons (MLP), 
      one of the most extensively used neural networks (NNs), to enhance its efficacy
      as a decision support tool for medical data classification. The proposed HOS-MLP 
      model is tested on four significant medical datasets: orthopedic patients,
      diabetes, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer, to assess HOS's success in
      training MLP. For verification, the results are compared with eleven different
      classifiers and eight well-regarded MLP trainer metaheuristic algorithms:
      particle swarm optimization (PSO), biogeography-based optimizer (BBO), the
      firefly algorithm (FFA), artificial bee colony (ABC), genetic algorithm (GA), bat
      algorithm (BAT), monarch butterfly optimizer (MBO), and the flower pollination
      algorithm (FPA). The experimental results demonstrate that the MLP trained by HOS
      outperforms the other comparative models regarding mean square error (MSE),
      classification accuracy, and convergence rate. The findings also reveal that the 
      HOS help the MLP to produce more accurate results than other classification
      algorithms for the prediction of diseases.

TI  - Treatment of Spider Phobia Using Repeated Exposures and Adjunctive Repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: A Proof-of-Concept Study.
PG  - 823158
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.823158 [doi]
AB  - Background: Specific phobias represent the largest category of anxiety disorders.
      Previous work demonstrated that stimulating the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
      (vmPFC) with repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) may improve
      response to exposure therapy for acrophobia. Objective: To examine feasibility of
      accelerating extinction learning in subjects with spider phobia using
      intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) rTMS of vmPFC. Methods: In total, 17 
      subjects with spider phobia determined by spider phobia questionnaires [Spider
      Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) and Fear of Spiders questionnaire (FSQ)] underwent
      ratings of fear of spiders as well as behavioral and skin conductance data during
      a behavioral avoidance test (BAT). Subjects then received a sequential protocol
      of in vivo spider exposure followed by iTBS for three sessions administered to
      either active or control treatment sites (vmPFC [n = 8] or vertex [n = 9],
      respectively), followed 1 week later by repetition of questionnaires and BAT.
      Results: All subjects improved significantly regardless of group across both
      questionnaires (FSQ eta(2) = 0.43, p = 0.004; SPQ eta(2) = 0.39, p = 0.008) and
      skin conductance levels during BAT (Wald chi(2) = 30.9, p < 0.001). Subjects in
      the vmPFC group tolerated lower treatment intensity than in the control group,
      and there was a significant correlation between treatment intensity, BAT
      subjective distress improvement, and physiologic measures (all rho > 0.5).
      Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary evidence that a
      sequential exposure and iTBS over vmPFC is feasible and may have rTMS
      intensity-dependent effects on treatment outcomes, providing evidence for future 
      areas of study in the use of rTMS for phobias.

TI  - Ovariectomy Interferes with Proteomes of Brown Adipose Tissue in Rats.
PG  - 499-510
LID - 10.7150/ijms.66996 [doi]
AB  - Postmenopausal women exhibit a higher prevalence of obesity due to decreased
      energy expenditure and increased food intake compared to their premenopausal
      counterparts. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a key role in energy homeostasis, 
      thus providing us with appealing therapeutic targets in obesity. However, how BAT
      proteomes are altered in response to low levels of estrogen remains unclear. To
      better understand the underlying mechanisms between the postmenopausal state and 
      BAT proteomic changes, our study aimed to investigate the effect of ovariectomy
      on the BAT proteome. In this study, eight-week-old female Sprague Dawley rats
      were randomly allocated into bilateral ovariectomy (Ovx) and sham operation
      (Sham) groups. Mass spectrometry was used for proteomics assay and Ingenuity
      Pathway Analysis was applied to examine the differentially regulated proteins. Of
      the 1,412 identified proteins, 18 proteins were significantly upregulated,
      whereas 36 proteins were significantly downregulated in the Ovx group as compared
      to the Sham group. Our findings demonstrate that the proteins involved in BAT
      morphology, the browning of white adipose tissue, and metabolic substrates for
      thermogenesis were regulated by ovariectomy. The dysregulation of proteins by
      ovariectomy might be related to the disruption of BAT function in the
      postmenopausal status. Understanding how BAT proteomes are altered in response to
      ovariectomy may illuminate novel therapeutic strategies for the management of
      postmenopausal weight gain in the future.

TI  - Nobiletin and 3'-Demethyl Nobiletin Activate Brown Adipocytes upon
      beta-Adrenergic Stimulation.
PG  - 528-533
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b21-00988 [doi]
AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) specifically regulates energy expenditure via heat
      production. Nobiletin (NOB), a natural polymethoxylated flavone present in citrus
      fruits, can activate thermogenesis in the BAT of high-fat diet-induced obese
      mice. The activity of BAT is directly regulated by beta-adrenergic stimulation.
      In this study, we report the effects of NOB on BAT activation using
      beta-adrenergic agonists. We observed that when HB2 brown adipocyte cell lines
      are stimulated with beta-adrenergic agonists, NOB enhances the expression of
      uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which is associated with the mitochondrial energy
      metabolism in these cells. Moreover, NOB increases the mRNA expression of the
      brown adipokines neuregulin-4 (Nrg4) and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21) and
      the secretion of FGF-21. These results suggest that NOB can enhance the
      thermogenic functions of brown adipocytes and promote brown adipokine secretion
      due to enhanced beta-adrenergic stimulation. In addition, 3'-demethyl nobiletin
      (3'-DMN), an NOB CYP-enzyme metabolite, can increase UCP1 mRNA expression. Both
      NOB and 3'-DMN significantly promoted mitochondrial membrane potential in HB2
      adipocytes following beta-adrenergic stimulation. Therefore, we believe that NOB 
      could be a promising candidate for activating BAT under beta-adrenergic
      stimulation and preventing the onset of obesity.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is a hormone with pleiotropic metabolic
      functions, leading to ongoing development of analogues for treatment of metabolic
      disorders. On the other hand, FGF19 is overexpressed in a sub-group of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and has oncogenic properties. It is
      therefore crucial to precisely define FGF19 effects, notably in the context of
      chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of the hormone. Here, we used
      hydrodynamic gene transfer to generate a transgenic mouse model with long-term
      FGF19 hepatic overexpression. We describe a novel effect of FGF19, namely the
      stimulation of water intake. This phenotype, lasting at least over a 6-month
      period, depends on signaling in the central nervous system and is independent of 
      FGF21, although it mimics some of its features. We further show that HCC patients
      with high levels of circulating FGF19 have a reduced natremia, indicating
      dipsogenic features. The present study provides evidence of a new activity of
      FGF19, which could be clinically relevant in the context of FGF19 overexpressing 
      cancers and in the course of treatment of metabolic disorders by FGF19 analogues.

TI  - Exploring the role of basophil activation test in diagnosis of Dermatophagoides
      farinae sensitization and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of subcutaneous
      immunotherapy in children.
PG  - e13168
LID - 10.1111/sji.13168 [doi]
AB  - It aims to detect basophil activation ratio (%CD63(+) ) in peripheral blood of
      children with allergic asthma and rhinitis by using flow cytometry (FCM), so as
      to analyse the application values and clinical relevance of the basophil
      activation test (BAT) in diagnosis of Dermatophagoides farinae (Derf)
      sensitization and monitoring therapeutic efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy
      (SCIT). It was a prospective study. From the newly diagnosed children with asthma
      and rhinitis in our paediatric clinic, 39 patients diagnosed Derf sensitization
      and 15 patients not allergic to Derf were enrolled; another 4 healthy children
      were taken as control group. Using Derf extracts in concentration of 1, 10 mug/mL
      and 100 mug/mL as the stimulus, BAT results were expressed as %CD63(+) in
      diagnosis of Derf sensitization and its correlation with skin prick tests (SPT), 
      serum total IgE (tIgE), specific IgE (sIgE), sIgE/tIgE, specific IgG4 (sIgG4),
      FEV1%pred in pulmonary ventilation function, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO),
      children asthma control test (C-ACT) and visual analogue scale (VAS) were
      observed. In sensitization group, %CD63(+) , sIgG4 and clinical indicators were
      detected again from patients who had received SCIT to analyse their internal
      connections. The average levels of %CD63(+) in 3 concentrations showed an
      increasing concentration-dependent trend overall. %CD63(+) in sensitization group
      was significantly higher than that in the other 2 groups. The analysis of ROC for
      Derf sensitization showed the area under the curve (AUC) for BAT in 3
      concentrations was higher than that for sIgE whose AUC is 0.893. %CD63(+) was
      positively correlated with SPT grade, sIgE, sIgE/tIgE and VAS, and negatively
      correlated with C-ACT. In patients receiving SCIT, %CD63(+) became lower and
      sIgG4 level became higher than pretreatment. There was no obvious change in sIgG4
      in those who had not received SCIT. BAT is a reliable and non-invasive tool for
      diagnosis of Derf sensitization in children with asthma and rhinitis. CD63-based 
      BAT has clinical value to monitor outcome of SCIT, and the change in basophil
      activation is inherently related to induction of sIgG4.

AB  - In the Neotropical region, the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi) is the
      rarest of the three species of vampire bats. This bat species feeds
      preferentially on bird blood, and there is limited information on the viruses
      infecting D. youngi. Hence, this study aimed to expand the knowledge about the
      viral diversity associated with D. youngi by sampling and pooling the lungs,
      liver, kidneys, heart, and intestines of all animals using high-throughput
      sequencing (HTS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of three complete and 10
      nearly complete circular virus genomes were closely related to gemykrogvirus
      (Genomoviridae family), smacovirus (Smacoviridae family), and torque teno viruses
      (TTVs) (Anelloviridae family). In addition, three sequences of bat paramyxovirus 
      were detected and found to be closely related to viruses reported in Pomona
      roundleaf bats and rodents. The present study provides a snapshot of the viral
      diversity associated with white-winged vampire bats and provides a baseline for
      comparison to viruses detected in future outbreaks.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny of coronaviruses and host receptors among domestic and
      close-contact animals reveals subgenome-level conservation, crossover, and
      divergence.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s12917-022-03217-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses have the potential to cross species barriers. To learn 
      the molecular intersections among the most common coronaviruses of domestic and
      close-contact animals, we analyzed representative coronavirus genera infecting
      mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, cattle, white-tailed deer, swine, ferret, mink,
      alpaca, Rhinolophus bat, dolphin, whale, chicken, duck and turkey hosts;
      reference or complete genome sequences were available for most of these
      coronavirus genera. Protein sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were built
      for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The 
      host receptors and enzymes aminopeptidase N (APN), angiotensin converting enzyme 
      2 (ACE2), sialic acid synthase (SAS), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), 
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), cathepsin L (and its analogs) and furin were also 
      compared. RESULTS: Overall, the S, E, M, and N proteins segregated according to
      their viral genera (alpha, beta, or gamma), but the S proteins of
      alphacoronaviruses lacked conservation of phylogeny. Interestingly, the unique
      polybasic furin cleavage motif found in severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) but not in severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
      exists in several beta-coronaviruses and a few alpha- or gamma-coronaviruses.
      Receptors and enzymes retained host species-dependent relationships with one
      another. Among the hosts, critical ACE2 residues essential for SARS-CoV-2 spike
      protein binding were most conserved in white-tailed deer and cattle. CONCLUSION: 
      The polybasic furin cleavage motif found in several beta- and other coronaviruses
      of animals points to the existence of an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, and it
      also offers a counternarrative to the theory of a laboratory-engineered virus.
      Generally, the S proteins of coronaviruses show crossovers of phylogenies
      indicative of recombination events. Additionally, the consistency in the
      segregation of viral proteins of the MERS-like coronavirus (NC_034440.1) from
      pipistrelle bat supports its classification as a beta-coronavirus. Finally,
      similarities in host enzymes and receptors did not always explain natural
      cross-infections. More studies are therefore needed to identify factors that
      determine the cross-species infectivity of coronaviruses.

TI  - FDA Approval Summary: Ruxolitinib for Treatment of Chronic Graft-Versus-Host
      Disease after Failure of One or Two Lines of Systemic Therapy.
PG  - 493-500
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac042 [doi]
AB  - On September 22, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration approved ruxolitinib for 
      the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after the failure of
      one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and
      older. Approval was based on Study INCB 18424-365 (REACH-3; CINC424D2301;
      NCT03112603), a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of ruxolitinib in
      comparison to best available therapy (BAT) for the treatment of
      corticosteroid-refractory cGVHD occurring after the allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation. A total of 329 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive
      either ruxolitinib 10 mg twice daily (n = 165) or BAT (n = 164). BAT was selected
      by the investigator prior to randomization. The overall response rate through
      Cycle 7 Day 1 was 70% (95% CI, 63-77) in the ruxolitinib arm, and 57% (95% CI,
      49-65) in the BAT arm. The median duration of response, calculated from first
      response to progression, death, or initiation of new systemic therapies for
      cGVHD, was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.2-6.7) for the ruxolitinib arm and 2.1 months
      (95% CI, 1.6-3.2) for the BAT arm; and the median time from first response to
      death or initiation of new systemic therapies for cGVHD was 25 months (95% CI,
      16.8-not estimable) for the ruxolitinib arm and 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.8) for 
      the BAT arm. Common adverse reactions included anemia, thrombocytopenia, and
      infections. Given the observed response rate with durability, the clinical
      benefit of ruxolitinib appears to outweigh the risks of treatment for cGVHD after
      the failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy.

TI  - Facial muscle modification associated with chiropteran noseleaf development:
      Insights into the developmental basis of a movable rostral appendage in mammals.
PG  - 1368-1379
LID - 10.1002/dvdy.472 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mammal evolution has generated diverse craniofacial morphologies,
      including remarkable movable rostral appendages. However, the muscular and
      skeletal architecture providing the mobility of these appendages remains largely 
      unexplored. Here, we focus on chiropteran noseleaves and compare the
      three-dimensional internal morphology of late-stage embryos between the greater
      horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, which possesses a noseleaf, and the
      Asian bent-winged bat Miniopterus fuliginosus and Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus
      aegyptiacus, which do not. We also assess earlier stage cell proliferation within
      the rostrum to elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying noseleaf-associated
      morphological modifications. RESULTS: The musculus maxillolabialis inserted into 
      proximal vibrissae follicles in M fuliginosus and R aegyptiacus embryos but
      instead inserted into the horseshoe plate in R ferrumequinum. This modification
      suggests that the M maxillolabialis has adapted to controlling the noseleaf
      rather than vibrissae in rhinolophid bats. Our cellular analysis showed higher
      cell proliferation within the maxillary and frontonasal processes of St. 14
      embryos in R ferrumequinum compared to M fuliginosus and R aegyptiacus,
      suggesting that the spatial alteration of noseleaf-associated muscle is derived
      from changes in facial morphogenesis that occur by St. 14. CONCLUSION: This is
      the first study clarifying the morphological and cellular bases underlying the
      development of mammalian rostral appendages.

TI  - Isolation of infectious Lloviu virus from Schreiber's bats in Hungary.
PG  - 1706
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-29298-1 [doi]
AB  - Some filoviruses can be transmitted to humans by zoonotic spillover events from
      their natural host and filovirus outbreaks have occured with increasing frequency
      in the last years. The filovirus Lloviu virus (LLOV), was identified in 2002 in
      Schreiber's bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Spain and was subsequently
      detected in bats in Hungary. Here we isolate infectious LLOV from the blood of a 
      live sampled Schreiber's bat in Hungary. The isolate is subsequently sequenced
      and cultured in the Miniopterus sp. kidney cell line SuBK12-08. It is furthermore
      able to infect monkey and human cells, suggesting that LLOV might have spillover 
      potential. A multi-year surveillance of LLOV in bats in Hungary detects LLOV RNA 
      in both deceased and live animals as well as in coupled ectoparasites from the
      families Nycteribiidae and Ixodidae. This correlates with LLOV seropositivity in 
      sampled Schreiber's bats. Our data support the role of bats, specifically
      Miniopterus schreibersii as hosts for LLOV in Europe. We suggest that
      bat-associated parasites might play a role in the natural ecology of filoviruses 
      in temperate climate regions compared to filoviruses in the tropics.

AB  - Brown adipocytes have been linked to managing human obesity and related metabolic
      diseases. A large number of natural products have emerged that can activate brown
      adipocytes tissue (BAT) to active thermogenesis, but the epigenetic mechanisms
      have not been fully resolved. In this study, we identified the induction of
      miR-124-3p by urolithin A (UA) as a means to increase the thermogenic activity of
      brown adipocytes. Overexpression of miR-124-3p enhances thermogenesis by
      increasing mitochondrial content in brown adipocytes. Mechanistically, to clarify
      that miR-124-3p affects fatty acid synthesis using bioinformatics methods, it is 
      clear that miR-124 affects the synthesis of fatty acids through the enrichment
      analysis of the KEGG pathway, and using dual luci. ferase to determine the target
      gene as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) while controlling rates of fatty acids
      synthesis and de novo brown fat biogenesis. Finally, in the overexpression of
      miR-124-3p and UA-treated BAT, succinate accumulation was enhanced in cells and
      fueled mitochondrial complex II activities. This study highlights a
      miR-124-3p/SCD1/succinate pathway that stimulates thermogenesis of BAT via the
      modulatory roles of UA.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a unique organ in mammals capable of dissipating
      energy in form of heat. Additionally, white adipose tissue (WAT) can undergo
      browning and perform thermogenesis. In recent years, the research community has
      aimed to harness thermogenic depot functions for new therapeutic strategies
      against obesity and the metabolic syndrome; hence a comprehensive understanding
      of the thermogenic fat microenvironment is essential. Akin to WAT, immune cells
      also infiltrate and reside within the thermogenic adipose tissues and perform
      vital functions. As highly plastic organs, adipose depots rely on crucial
      interplay with these tissue resident cells to conserve their healthy state.
      Evidence has accumulated to show that different immune cell populations
      contribute to thermogenic adipose tissue homeostasis and activation through
      complex communicative networks. Furthermore, new studies have identified -but
      still not fully characterized further- numerous immune cell populations present
      in these depots. Here, we review the current knowledge of this emerging field by 
      describing the immune cells that sway the thermogenic adipose depots, and the
      complex array of communications that influence tissue performance.

AB  - Agricultural soils are exposed to multiple contaminants through the use of
      agrochemicals or sewage sludge, introducing metals, nanomaterials and others.
      Among nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are known for their large surface
      area and adsorption capabilities, possibly modifying other element behavior.
      However, to date, very little is known about the impacts of such interactions in 
      agrosystems. In this study, we aimed at understanding the transfer and toxicity
      of contaminants (Cd, Pb, Zn and CNTs) in microcosms including native soil
      bacteria, earthworms and lettuce. After a 6 week exposure, no effect of the
      addition of CNTs to metal contaminated soils was detected on bacterial
      concentration or earthworm growth. However, in lettuce, an interactive effect
      between CNTs and metals was highlighted: in the soil containing the highest metal
      concentrations the addition of 0.1mgkg(-1) CNTs led to a biomass loss (-22%) and 
      a flavonoid concentration increase (+27%). In parallel, the addition of CNTs led 
      to differential impacts on elemental uptake in lettuce leaves possibly related to
      the soil organic matter content. For earthworms, the addition of 10mgkg(-1) CNTs 
      resulted in an increased body elemental transfer in the soil with the higher
      organic matter content (Pb: + 34% and Zn: + 25%).

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of rabies and habitat suitability of the common marmoset
      Callithrix jacchus in Brazil.
PG  - e0010254
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010254 [doi]
AB  - Rabies transmitted by wildlife is now the main source of human rabies in the
      Americas. The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, is considered a reservoir of
      rabies causing sporadic and unpredictable human deaths in Brazil, but the extent 
      of the spillover risk to humans remains unknown. In this study, we described the 
      spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies affecting C. jacchus reported to Brazil's
      Ministry of Health passive surveillance system between 2008 and 2020, and
      combined ecological niche modelling with C. jacchus occurrence data to predict
      its suitable habitat. Our results show that 67 outbreaks (91 cases) of rabies
      affecting C. jacchus were reported by 41 municipalities between January 2008 and 
      October 2020, with a mean of 5 outbreaks/year [range: 1-14]. The maximum number
      of outbreaks and municipalities reporting cases occurred in 2018, coinciding with
      higher surveillance of primate deaths due to Yellow Fever. A mean of 3 [1-9] new 
      municipalities reported outbreaks yearly, suggesting potential spatial expansions
      of the C. jacchus variant in northeastern Brazil and emerging rabies spillover
      from vampire bat Desmodus rotundus to C. jacchus in the north and south.
      Outbreaks were concentrated in the states of Ceara (72%) and Pernambuco (16%) up 
      to 2012, but are now reported in Piaui since 2013, in Bahia since 2017 (D.
      rotundus' antigenic variant, AgV3) and in Rio de Janeiro since 2019 (AgV3).
      Besides confirming suitable habitat for this primate in the northeast and the
      east coast of Brazil, our Maximum Entropy model also predicted suitable habitat
      on the north and the west states of the country but predicted low habitat
      suitability among inland municipalities of the Caatinga biome reporting rabies.
      Our findings revealed new areas reporting rabies infecting C. jacchus,
      highlighting the need to implement strategies limiting spillover to humans and to
      better understand the drivers of C. jacchus rabies dynamics.

TI  - Bony Apprehension Test for Identifying Bone Loss in Patients With Traumatic
      Anterior Shoulder Instability: A Validation Study.
PG  - 1520-1528
LID - 10.1177/03635465221085673 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of bone loss has important implications for the surgical
      treatment of patients with recurrent shoulder instability. The bony apprehension 
      test (BAT) is a physical examination maneuver that was designed to improve
      specificity from the anterior apprehension test (AAT) in detecting critical bone 
      loss. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the BAT with the AAT and 
      relocation test based on their abilities to predict critical bone loss. Several
      well-described criteria were utilized to capture critical (>/=25%) and
      subcritical (>/=13.5%) glenoid defects, as well as Hill-Sachs defects (>/=19%).
      The ability of the BAT to predict bipolar bone loss was also assessed, as
      indicated by engaging Hill-Sachs defects and off-track lesions. STUDY DESIGN:
      Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: The study cohort
      included patients >/=18 years of age who were scheduled to undergo arthroscopic
      stabilization for traumatic anterior shoulder instability. Notable exclusion
      criteria included multidirectional shoulder instability, connective tissue
      disorders, and workers' compensation or litigation cases. Patients underwent
      physical examination immediately before surgery by the treating surgeon (ie,
      before the induction of anesthesia). Critical glenoid and humeral bone defects
      were measured on preoperative computed tomography scans. Hill-Sachs engagement
      and on- or off-track determination of bone loss were assessed arthroscopically
      and via computed tomography, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were
      included in the study. In cases of subcritical glenoid bone loss (>/=13.5%) and
      critical Hill-Sachs defects (>/=19%), the BAT had good and fair specificity (82% 
      and 72%, respectively) but poor sensitivity (40% and 39%). The BAT also had poor 
      sensitivity (0%), specificity (67%), and positive predictive value (0%) for
      higher percentages of glenoid bone loss (>/=25%). When engaging Hill-Sachs
      lesions were assessed, the BAT had excellent specificity (94%) and positive
      predictive value (94%) but poor sensitivity (43%) and negative predictive value
      (44%). Furthermore, the BAT performed poorly at predicting off-track humeral
      lesions. The AAT demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 0% specificity in detecting
      all measures of bone loss. CONCLUSION: The BAT performed poorly at identifying
      subcritical and critical bone loss and was not found to have any clinical value. 
      Future work is needed to identify a physical examination test that could
      complement advanced imaging for preoperative assessment of critical bone loss.

TI  - Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT): A patient's guide.
PG  - 753-762
LID - 10.1002/pros.24328 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) is a new treatment concept for men whose prostate 
      cancer has become resistant to standard hormone-blocking therapy. Over the past
      decade, we have performed a series of clinical studies testing BAT in
      asymptomatic men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The key findings from
      these clinical studies are that BAT (a) can be safely administered to
      asymptomatic patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; (b)
      does not produce symptomatic disease progression; (c) produces sustained
      prostate-specific antigen and objective responses in 30%-40% of patients; and (d)
      can resensitize and prolong response to subsequent antiandrogen therapy. The
      concept of BAT has generated significant interest from men with prostate cancer, 
      their families, and their physicians. Here we provide a "Patient's Guide" that
      answers questions about BAT in a form that is accessible to patients, their
      families, and physicians. Our goal is to provide information to help patients
      make the most informed decisions they can regarding their prostate cancer
      treatment.

TI  - Early Lipid Metabolic Effects of the Anti-Psychotic Drug Olanzapine on Weight
      Gain and the Associated Gene Expression.

AB  - Background: Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine often cause metabolic side
      effects such as obesity and diabetes, leading to an increased risk of
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate
      the effects of olanzapine treatment on hepatic lipid metabolism and its possible 
      relationship with adipose tissue status. Methods: Using a female rat model, we
      investigated the effects of chronic olanzapine administration on the regulation
      of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism including lipid biosynthesis, oxidation,
      efflux, and lipolysis in liver and adipose tissue. Results: The body weight,
      liver mass and visceral adiposity after olanzapine treatment (2 mg/kg) for five
      weeks were not significantly different compared with vehicle controls. The serum 
      level of triglycerides was higher in the vehicle controls than in
      olanzapine-treated rats. Unexpectedly, olanzapine treatment did not reduce
      glucose tolerance in our model. The expression of functional thermogenic protein 
      uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) was increased in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of the
      olanzapine group. Additionally, olanzapine treatment also reduced adipose
      inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT). The transcription factor sterol
      regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a key early regulator of
      lipogenesis, was downregulated following olanzapine treatment. The expression of 
      genes related to the triglycerides synthesis apparatus in the liver was
      upregulated in the olanzapine group. Olanzapine treatment induced genes involved 
      in PPAR-alpha signaling and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in response to
      increased ATGL-mediated lipolysis in the liver. Conclusion: Together, our
      findings suggest a complicated link between olanzapine therapy and metabolic
      disturbance and may garner interest in assessing the action of
      antipsychotic-induced metabolic disturbances.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate uncoupler protein 1 (UCP1) in brown
      adipose tissue (BAT) under physiological cold exposure and noradrenaline (NA)
      stimulation to increase thermogenesis. However, the endogenous regulator of ROS
      in activated BAT and its role in pathological conditions remain unclear. We show 
      that serum levels of selenoprotein P (SeP; encoded by SELENOP) negatively
      correlate with BAT activity in humans. Physiological cold exposure downregulates 
      Selenop in BAT. Selenop knockout mice show higher rectal temperatures and UCP1
      sulfenylation during cold exposure. SeP treatment to brown adipocytes eliminated 
      the NA-induced mitochondrial ROS by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 and
      impaired cellular thermogenesis. A high-fat/high-sucrose diet elevates serum SeP 
      levels and diminishes the elevated NA-induced thermogenesis in BAT-Selenop KO
      mice. Therefore, SeP is the intrinsic factor inducing reductive stress that
      impairs thermogenesis in BAT and may be a potential therapeutic target for
      obesity and diabetes.

TI  - Serological survey of lyssaviruses in synanthropic bats and human exposure to
      bats in Slovakia.
PG  - 44-49

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bats are considered natural reservoirs for lyssaviruses. A total of
      17 out of 19 known lyssaviruses circulate in bat populations. Lyssaviruses cause 
      rabies in animals and humans. The transmission of lyssaviruses from European bats
      to terrestrial animals and humans is rare, but the risk of infection still exists
      even in developed countries. Slovakia is currently a rabies-free country.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the potential circulation of EBLV-1
      in synanthropic bats present in human inhabited buildings, and to give an
      overview of human exposure to bats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A passive serological
      survey targeted the prevalence of antibodies to bat lyssaviruses in synanthropic 
      bats between 2009 - 2019. A total of 598 bats of the species Pipistrellus
      pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Eptesicus serotinus, Nyctalus noctula and
      Vespertilio murinus were captured in buildings mainly in Eastern Slovakia, and
      examined by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). RESULTS:
      Lyssavirus-specific antibodies were detected in 2 (0.3%) of the 598 examined
      bats. Additionally, brain tissues of bats found dead were examined using the
      standard fluorescent antibody test (FAT) with negative results. An overview of
      available data on human exposure to bats recorded in Slovakia from 2007 - 2019 is
      also included. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the presence of lyssavirus
      antibodies in synanthropic bats in Slovakia, suggesting the active circulation of
      bat lyssaviruses in bat populations exploiting human buildings. Although the
      seroprevalence was found to be extremely low, the results show that any case of
      human exposure to bats must be treated with caution in order to protect public
      health.

TI  - EBI2 is a negative modulator of brown adipose tissue energy expenditure in mice
      and human brown adipocytes.
PG  - 280
LID - 10.1038/s42003-022-03201-6 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an attractive
      approach for increasing energy expenditure to counteract obesity. Given the
      side-effects of known activators of BAT, we studied inhibitors of BAT as a novel,
      alternative concept to regulate energy expenditure. We focused on
      G-protein-coupled receptors that are one of the major targets of clinically used 
      drugs. Here, we identify GPR183, also known as EBI2, as the most highly expressed
      inhibitory G-protein-coupled receptor in BAT among the receptors examined.
      Activation of EBI2 using its endogenous ligand 7alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol
      significantly decreases BAT-mediated energy expenditure in mice. In contrast,
      mice deficient for EBI2 show increased energy dissipation in response to cold.
      Interestingly, only thermogenic adipose tissue depots - BAT and subcutaneous
      white adipose tissue -respond to 7alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol treatment/EBI2
      activation but not gonadal white fat, which has the lowest thermogenic capacity. 
      EBI2 activation in brown adipocytes significantly reduces norepinephrine-induced 
      cAMP production, whereas pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of EBI2
      results in an increased response. Importantly, EBI2 significantly inhibits
      norepinephrine-induced activation of human brown adipocytes. Our data identify
      the 7alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol/EBI2 signaling pathway as a so far unknown BAT
      inhibitor. Understanding the inhibitory regulation of BAT might lead to novel
      pharmacological approaches to increase the activity of thermogenic adipose tissue
      and whole body energy expenditure in humans.

TI  - Differences Between Ipsilateral and Contralateral Early Parenchymal Enhancement
      Kinetics Predict Response of Breast Cancer to Neoadjuvant Therapy.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether kinetics measured with ultrafast
      dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in tumor and normal
      parenchyma pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) can predict the response of
      breast cancer to NAT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with
      histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer were enrolled. They were scanned 
      with ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (3-7
      seconds/frame) pre- and post-NAT. Four kinetic parameters were calculated in the 
      segmented tumors, and ipsi- and contra-lateral normal parenchyma: (1) tumor
      (tSE30) or background parenchymal relative enhancement at 30 seconds (BPE30), (2)
      maximum relative enhancement slope (MaxSlope), (3) bolus arrival time (BAT), and 
      (4) area under relative signal enhancement curve for the initial 30 seconds
      (AUC30). The tumor kinetics and the differences between ipsi- and contra-lateral 
      parenchymal kinetics were compared for patients achieving pathologic complete
      response (pCR) vs those who had residual disease after NAT. The chi-squared test 
      and two-sided t-test were used for baseline demographics. The Wilcoxon rank sum
      test and one-way analysis of variance were used for differential responses to
      therapy. RESULTS: Patients with similar pre-NAT mean BPE30, median BAT and mean
      AUC30 in the ipsi- and contralateral normal parenchyma were more likely to
      achieve pCR following NAT (p < 0.02). Patients classified as having residual
      cancer burden (RCB) II after NAT showed higher post-NAT tSE30 and tumor AUC30 and
      higher post-NAT MaxSlope in ipsilateral normal parenchyma compared to those
      classified as RCB I or pCR (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bilateral asymmetry in normal 
      parenchyma could predict treatment outcome prior to NAT. Post-NAT tumor kinetics 
      could evaluate the aggressiveness of residual tumor.

TI  - Microsatellite Instability Analysis and Its Prognostic Value in Invasive
      Nonampullary Duodenal Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 290-302
LID - 10.1159/000519805 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nonampullary duodenal adenocarcinoma (NADA) is a rare disease. Although 
      several prognostic factors have been reported for this disease, they remain
      controversial due to their rarity. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 54 
      cases of invasive NADA, focusing on the microsatellite instability (MSI)
      phenotype, programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and prognostic
      factors. METHODS: Expression of the PD-L1 protein and cell differentiation
      markers in tumors was detected by immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite markers
      (NR-21, NR-22, NR-24, BAT-25, and BAT-26) were amplified for MSI assessment by
      PCR. RESULTS: The incidence of MSI in invasive NADA was 35.2%. No significant
      correlation between the MSI phenotype and clinicopathological factors was
      observed. Positive expression of PD-L1 by immune cells was common in
      advanced-stage disease (p = 0.054), and positive expression of PD-L1 in cancer
      cells correlated significantly with the histologically undifferentiated type (p =
      0.016). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significantly better
      overall survival (OS) in patients with MSI (p = 0.013) and at early-stage disease
      (p = 0.000) than in those with microsatellite-stable or at late tumor stages.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that MSI (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.282,
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.106-0.751, p = 0.011) and early tumor stage
      (stage I-II) (HR: 8.81, 95% CI: 2.545-30.500, p = 0.001) were independent better 
      prognostic factors of OS. CONCLUSIONS: MSI and early tumor stage (stage I-II)
      were independent better prognostic factors of OS. A high proportion of MSI
      phenotypes and positive PD-L1 expression may be helpful for identifying immune
      checkpoint inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Although viruses are known to modify the free radical concentration in infected
      cells, the exact location and concentrations of such changes remain unknown.
      Although this information is important to understand the virus pathogenesis and
      design better anti-viral drugs or vaccines, obtaining it with the conventional
      free radical/ROS detection techniques is impossible. Here, we elucidate the
      utility of diamond magnetometry for studying the free radical response of baby
      hamster kidney-21 cells upon Semliki Forest virus infection. Specifically, we
      optically probe the alterations in free radical concentration near infectious
      viruses via measuring the spin-lattice relaxation (T1) of NV defect ensembles
      embedded in intracellular nanodiamonds. We performed measurements both at random 
      locations as well as close to the virus entry by conjugating viruses to
      nanodiamond sensors. We observed alterations of T1, which represent the
      intracellular free radical concentration during the viral replication process.
      Moreover, relaxometry is also used to monitor real-time free radical variation
      during the early infectious process.

PG  - e2113628119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2113628119 [doi]
AB  - SignificanceThe clear need to mitigate zoonotic risk has fueled increased viral
      discovery in specific reservoir host taxa. We show that a combination of viral
      and reservoir traits can predict zoonotic virus virulence and transmissibility in
      humans, supporting the hypothesis that bats harbor exceptionally virulent
      zoonoses. However, pandemic prevention requires thinking beyond zoonotic
      capacity, virulence, and transmissibility to consider collective "burden" on
      human health. For this, viral discovery targeting specific reservoirs may be
      inefficient as death burden correlates with viral, not reservoir, traits, and
      depends on context-specific epidemiological dynamics across and beyond the
      human-animal interface. These findings suggest that longitudinal studies of viral
      dynamics in reservoir and spillover host populations may offer the most effective
      strategy for mitigating zoonotic risk.

TI  - Temporal specificity of IL-6 knockout in enhancing the thermogenic capability of 
      brown adipose tissue.
LID - 10.1007/s13105-021-00847-4 [doi]
AB  - Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been regarded as a homeostatic regulator of fat
      metabolism, its role in brown adipose thermogenesis remains to be further
      clarified. By using wild-type (WT) and IL-6-knockout (KO) mice, this study aims
      to investigate whether IL-6 regulates the thermogenic capability of brown adipose
      tissue (BAT) at both young and elderly stages. We demonstrated that IL-6 KO
      enhances BAT thermogenesis at a young age, as evidenced by the increased mRNA and
      protein expression levels of thermogenic genes, and the elevated interscapular
      surface temperature. The IL-6-KO enhancement of BAT thermogenesis is associated
      with improved respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and glucose homeostasis at young
      stages. However, these improvements disappear in elderly KO mice, which is likely
      attributable to the highly increased expression of other inflammatory cytokines, 
      such as Tnfalpha, Il-1beta, and Il-10. Our findings indicate that the lack of
      IL-6 has a temporal-specific contribution to the promotion of BAT thermogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessing the global risk of rabies exposure is a complicated task
      requiring individual risk assessments, knowledge of rabies epidemiology,
      surveillance capacity and accessibility of rabies biologics on a national and
      regional scale. In many parts of the world, availability of this information is
      limited and when available is often dispersed across multiple sources. This
      hinders the process of making evidence-based health and policy recommendations to
      prevent the introduction and spread of rabies. METHODS: CDC conducted a
      country-by-country qualitative assessment of risk and protective factors for
      rabies to develop an open-access database of core metrics consisting of the
      presence of lyssaviruses (specifically canine or wildlife rabies virus variants
      or other bat lyssaviruses), access to rabies immunoglobulins and vaccines, rabies
      surveillance capacity and canine rabies control capacity. Using these metrics, we
      developed separate risk scoring systems to inform rabies prevention guidance for 
      travelers and regulations for the importation of dogs. Both scoring systems
      assigned higher risk to countries with enzootic rabies (particularly canine
      rabies), and the risk scoring system for travelers also considered protective
      factors such as the accessibility of rabies biologics for post-exposure
      prophylaxis. Cumulative scores were calculated across the assessed metrics to
      assign a risk value of low, moderate or high. RESULTS: A total of 240 countries, 
      territories and dependencies were assessed, for travelers, 116 were identified as
      moderate to high risk and 124 were low or no risk; for canine rabies virus
      variant importation, 111 were identified as high-risk and 129 were low or no
      risk. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a comprehensive and easily accessible source of
      information for assessing the rabies risk for individual countries that included 
      a database of rabies risk and protective factors based on enzootic status and
      availability of biologics, provided a resource that categorizes risk by country
      and provided guidance based on these risk categories for travelers and importers 
      of dogs into the United States.

AB  - Chronic obesity damages the cytoarchitecture of brown adipose tissue (BAT),
      leading to whitening of brown adipocytes and impaired thermogenesis,
      characterizing BAT dysfunction. Understanding the pathways of whitening
      progression can bring new targets to counter obesity. This study aimed to
      evaluate the chronic effect (12, 16, and 20 weeks) of a high-fat diet (50% energy
      as fat) upon energy expenditure, thermogenic markers, and pathways involved in
      BAT whitening in C57BL/6J mice. Sixty adult male mice comprised six nutritional
      groups, where the letters refer to the diet type (control, C or high-fat, HF),
      and the numbers refer to the period (in weeks) of diet administration: C12, HF12,
      C16, HF16, C20, and HF20. After sacrifice, biochemical, molecular, and
      stereological analyses addressed the outcomes. The HF groups had overweight, oral
      glucose intolerance, and hyperleptinemia, resulting in progressive whitening of
      BAT and decreased numerical density of nuclei per area of tissue compared to
      age-matched control groups. In addition, the whitening maximization was related
      to altered batokines gene expression, decreased nonshivering thermogenesis, and
      body temperature, resulting in low energy expenditure. The HF20 group showed
      enlarged adipocytes with stable and dysfunctional lipid droplets, followed by
      inflammation and ER stress. In conclusion, chronic HF diet intake caused
      time-dependent maximization of whitening with defective nonshivering
      thermogenesis. Long-term BAT dysfunction includes down-regulated vascularization 
      markers, upregulated inflammasome activation, and ER stress markers.

TI  - Nucleophosmin3 carried by small extracellular vesicles contribute to white
      adipose tissue browning.
PG  - 165
LID - 10.1186/s12951-022-01381-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a particularly appealing
      target for therapeutics in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic
      diseases. Although small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) released from adipose
      tissue (sEVs-AT) have emerged as novel player that regulate systemic metabolism
      by connecting different organs, the role of specific contents in sEVs-AT played
      in WAT browning has not been clarified. RESULTS: We revealed Nucleophosmin3
      (NPM3), which was mainly transferred by sEVs derived from brown adipose tissue
      (sEVs-BAT), was served as a batokine that could induce WAT browning by regulating
      the stability of PRDM16 mRNA. sEVs-BAT enhanced the expressions of browning
      related genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and WAT while knocking down of NPM3 in BAT 
      impaired sEVs-BAT mediated WAT browning and weight loss in obesity. CONCLUSION:
      These data provided new insight into the role of NPM3 in regulating the browning 
      of WAT. Our study indicated that a supplement of sEVs-BAT might represent a
      promising therapeutic strategy to promote thermogenesis and energy expenditure in
      the future.

TI  - Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Shows Cross-Protection against Bat SARS-Related
      Coronaviruses in Human ACE2 Transgenic Mice.
PG  - e0016922
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00169-22 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 are
      highly pathogenic to humans and have caused pandemics in 2003 and 2019,
      respectively. Genetically diverse SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have
      been detected or isolated from bats, and some of these viruses have been
      demonstrated to utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a
      receptor and to have the potential to spill over to humans. A pan-sarbecovirus
      vaccine that provides protection against SARSr-CoV infection is urgently needed. 
      In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 
      vaccine against recombinant SARSr-CoVs carrying two different spike proteins
      (named rWIV1 and rRsSHC014S, respectively). Although serum neutralizing assays
      showed limited cross-reactivity between the three viruses, the inactivated
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provided full protection against SARS-CoV-2 and rWIV1 and
      partial protection against rRsSHC014S infection in human ACE2 transgenic mice.
      Passive transfer of SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated mouse sera provided low protection for 
      rWIV1 but not for rRsSHC014S infection in human ACE2 mice. A specific cellular
      immune response induced by WIV1 membrane protein peptides was detected in the
      vaccinated animals, which may explain the cross-protection of the inactivated
      vaccine. This study shows the possibility of developing a pan-sarbecovirus
      vaccine against SARSr-CoVs for future preparedness. IMPORTANCE The genetic
      diversity of SARSr-CoVs in wildlife and their potential risk of cross-species
      infection highlight the necessity of developing wide-spectrum vaccines against
      infection of various SARSr-CoVs. In this study, we tested the protective efficacy
      of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (IAV) against two SARSr-CoVs with different
      spike proteins in human ACE2 transgenic mice. We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 
      IAV provides full protection against rWIV1 and partial protection against
      rRsSHC014S. The T-cell response stimulated by the M protein may account for the
      cross protection against heterogeneous SARSr-CoVs. Our findings suggest the
      feasibility of the development of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines, which can be a
      strategy of preparedness for future outbreaks caused by novel SARSr-CoVs from
      wildlife.

TI  - Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-positive patients.
PG  - 544-553
LID - 10.1177/09564624221076605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic mycosis among people living
      with advanced HIV infection. PURPOSE: Describe general aspects and challenges of 
      this disease and its association with HIV. RESEARCH DESIGN: Review of literature.
      STUDY SAMPLE: Articles found using different combinations of terms including
      "disseminated histoplasmosis" and AIDS/HIV or immunosuppression in PubMed,
      Scopus, WHO Global health library, and Scielo database. ANALYSIS: We look for
      information on epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of
      histoplasmosis in AIDS patients. RESULTS: Histoplasmosis is caused by Histoplasma
      capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus encountered throughout the world, mainly in soil
      enriched with bat and bird excreta. Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is
      the main presentation of this mycosis in people living with advanced HIV and is
      fatal if left untreated. Symptoms include a systemic disease characterized by
      fever, weight loss, night sweats, skin manifestations, hepatomegaly,
      splenomegaly, and septic shock. Diagnostic tests include culture, visualization
      of H. capsulatum by direct and histopathological examination, serology, antigen, 
      molecular, and skin testing. Patients with disseminated disease require
      aggressive and prolonged treatment to eradicate the pathogen and include
      amphotericin B and itraconazole. In many low income countries of endemic regions,
      histoplasmosis in HIV-positive patients is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as
      another opportunistic infection, due to the similarity in clinical manifestations
      and to the paucity of better diagnostic tests. CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis remains
      a neglected disease. Few studies about the disease and expensive treatments make 
      it difficult to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this condition. Public
      health services and physicians must be aware of histoplasmosis' burden among the 
      HIV-positive population.

TI  - First evidence that an emerging mammalian alphacoronavirus is able to infect an
      avian species.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14535 [doi]
AB  - A novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome
      coronavirus (SADS-CoV), related to Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU2 in the subgenus
      Rhinacovirus emerged in southern China in 2017, causing diarrhoea in newborn
      piglets, and critical questions remain about the pathogenicity, cross-species
      transmission and potential animal reservoirs. Our laboratory's previous research 
      has shown that SADS-CoV can replicate in various cell types from different
      species, including chickens. Here, we systematically explore the susceptibility
      of chickens to a cell-adapted SADS-CoV strain both in vitro and in vivo. First,
      evidence of SADS-CoV replication in primary chicken cells, including cytopathic
      effects, immunofluorescence staining, growth curves and structural protein
      expression, was proven. Furthermore, we observed that SADS-CoV replicated in
      chicken embryos without causing gross lesions and that experimental infection of 
      chicks resulted in mild respiratory symptoms. More importantly, SADS-CoV shedding
      and viral distribution in the lungs, spleens, small intestines and large
      intestines of infected chickens were confirmed by quantitative reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The genomic
      sequence of the original SADS-CoV from the pig source sample in 2017 was
      determined to have nine nucleotide differences compared to the cell-adapted
      strain used; among these were three nonsynonymous mutations in the spike gene.
      These results collectively demonstrate that chickens are susceptible to SADS-CoV 
      infection, suggesting that they are a potential animal reservoir. To our
      knowledge, this study provides the first experimental evidence of cross-species
      infection in which a mammalian alphacoronavirus is able to infect an avian
      species.

TI  - Sequential class switch recombination to IgE and allergen-induced accumulation of
      IgE(+) plasmablasts occur in the nasal mucosa of local allergic rhinitis
      patients.
LID - 10.1111/all.15292 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The involvement of allergen-specific (s)IgE in local allergic
      rhinitis (LAR) has been debated. Here, we investigate the effect of nasal
      allergen challenge with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (NAC-DP) in mucosal and
      peripheral B-cell subpopulations in LAR patients. METHODS: Nine LAR, 5 allergic
      rhinitis (AR), and 5 non-atopic healthy control (HC) individuals were subjected
      to a 3-day NAC-DP protocol, and nasal biopsies and blood samples were collected
      before and after provocation. Nasal biopsies were used for immunohistochemistry
      and gene expression studies, whereas the frequency of lymphocyte subsets and
      basophil activation test (BAT) were analyzed in blood samples by flow cytometry. 
      sIgG was measured in sera. RESULTS: NAC-DP induced an increase in IgE(+) CD38(+) 
      plasmablasts in the nasal mucosa of LAR patients, but not in AR or HC
      individuals. Markers of sequential recombination to IgE (epsilonCSR) (from IgG)
      were observed in 33% of LAR, 20% of AR, and 0% of HC subjects. NAC-DP increased
      the proportion of peripheral CD19(+) CD20(+) CD38(+) plasmablasts in AR and LAR
      patients, but not in HC. Expression of the mucosal homing receptor CXCR3 in
      peripheral CD19(+) CD20(+) CD38(+) plasmablasts from LAR, AR, and HC individuals 
      was 7%, 5%, and 0.5%, respectively. In vitro DP stimulation increased
      proliferating CD19(+) CD20(+) CD38(+) plasmablasts in LAR and AR patients, but
      not in HC. Serum DP-sIgG was higher in LAR and AR patients as compared to HC. BAT
      was positive in 33%, 100%, and 0% of LAR, AR, and HC subjects, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that allergen exposure induces the sequential
      epsilonCSR of IgG(+) CD19(+) CD20(+) CD38(+) plasmablasts in the nasal mucosa of 
      LAR patients.

AB  - Obesity occurs when energy intake overtops energy expenditure. Promoting
      activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) has been 
      proven a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity. Baicalin (BAI) has been
      shown to be protective for various animal models of cardiovascular diseases, such
      as pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis and myocardial hypertrophy. However,
      whether BAI could stimulate activation of BAT or browning of WAT remains unknown.
      Here we show that BAI limits weight gaining, ameliorates glucose tolerance,
      improves cold tolerance and promotes brown-like tissue formation in diet induced 
      obesity mice model. BAI increases the mitochondrial copy number as judged by
      mtDNA detection. BAI also increases the expression of UCP1 and other classical
      browning-specific genes in BAT and WAT and cultured C3H10T1/2 adipocytes through 
      a mechanism involving AMPK/PGC1alpha pathway. Collectively, our study established
      a role for BAI in regulating energy metabolism, which will provide new idea and
      theoretical basis for the treatment of obesity.

AB  - Many species of echinoderms have long been considered model research organisms in
      biology. Historically, much of this research has focused on the embryology of sea
      urchins and the use of their extensive gene regulatory networks as a tool to
      understand how the genome controls cell state specification and patterning. The
      establishment of Patiria miniata, the bat sea star, as a research organism has
      allowed us to expand on the concepts explored with sea urchins, viewing these
      genetic networks through a comparative lens, gaining great insight into the
      evolutionary mechanisms that shape developmental diversity. Extensive molecular
      tools have been developed in P. miniata, designed to explore gene expression
      dynamics and build gene regulatory networks. Echinoderms also have a robust set
      of bioinformatic and computational resources, centered around echinobase.org, an 
      extensive database containing multiomic, developmental, and experimental
      resources for researchers. In addition to comparative evolutionary development,

TI  - Conserved Targets to Prevent Emerging Coronaviruses.
LID - 563 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030563 [doi]
AB  - Novel coronaviruses emerged as zoonotic outbreaks in humans in 2003 (SARS), 2012 
      (MERS), and notably in 2019 (SARS2), which resulted in the COVID-19 pandemic,
      causing worldwide health and economic disaster. Vaccines provide the best
      protection against disease but cannot be developed and engineered quickly enough 
      to prevent emerging viruses, zoonotic outbreaks, and pandemics. Antivirals are
      the best first line of therapeutic defense against novel emerging viruses.
      Coronaviruses are plus sense, single stranded, RNA genome viruses that undergo
      frequent genetic mutation and recombination, allowing for the emergence of novel 
      coronavirus strains and variants. The molecular life cycle of the coronavirus
      family offers many conserved activities to be exploited as targets for
      antivirals. Here, we review the molecular life cycle of coronaviruses and
      consider antiviral therapies, approved and under development, that target the
      conserved activities of coronaviruses. To identify additional targets to inhibit 
      emerging coronaviruses, we carried out in silico sequence and structure analysis 
      of coronavirus proteins isolated from bat and human hosts. We highlight conserved
      and accessible viral protein domains and residues as possible targets for the
      development of viral inhibitors. Devising multiple antiviral therapies that
      target conserved viral features to be used in combination is the best first line 
      of therapeutic defense to prevent emerging viruses from developing into outbreaks
      and pandemics.

TI  - Dynamics of Antibodies to Ebolaviruses in an Eidolon helvum Bat Colony in
      Cameroon.
LID - 560 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030560 [doi]
AB  - The ecology of ebolaviruses is still poorly understood and the role of bats in
      outbreaks needs to be further clarified. Straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon
      helvum) are the most common fruit bats in Africa and antibodies to ebolaviruses
      have been documented in this species. Between December 2018 and November 2019,
      samples were collected at approximately monthly intervals in roosting and feeding
      sites from 820 bats from an Eidolon helvum colony. Dried blood spots (DBS) were
      tested for antibodies to Zaire, Sudan, and Bundibugyo ebolaviruses. The
      proportion of samples reactive with GP antigens increased significantly with age 
      from 0-9/220 (0-4.1%) in juveniles to 26-158/225 (11.6-70.2%) in immature adults 
      and 10-225/372 (2.7-60.5%) in adult bats. Antibody responses were lower in
      lactating females. Viral RNA was not detected in 456 swab samples collected from 
      152 juvenile and 214 immature adult bats. Overall, our study shows that antibody 
      levels increase in young bats suggesting that seroconversion to Ebola or related 
      viruses occurs in older juvenile and immature adult bats. Multiple year
      monitoring would be needed to confirm this trend. Knowledge of the periods of the
      year with the highest risk of Ebolavirus circulation can guide the implementation
      of strategies to mitigate spill-over events.

TI  - Alphacoronavirus in a Daubenton's Myotis Bat (Myotis daubentonii) in Sweden.
LID - 556 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030556 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated a search for reservoirs and species 
      potentially involved in back and forth transmission. Studies have postulated bats
      as one of the key reservoirs of coronaviruses (CoVs), and different CoVs have
      been detected in bats. So far, CoVs have not been found in bats in Sweden and we 
      therefore tested whether they carry CoVs. In summer 2020, we sampled a total of
      77 adult bats comprising 74 Myotis daubentonii, 2 Pipistrellus pygmaeus, and 1 M.
      mystacinus bats in southern Sweden. Blood, saliva and feces were sampled,
      processed and subjected to a virus next-generation sequencing target enrichment
      protocol. An Alphacoronavirus was detected and sequenced from feces of a M.
      daubentonii adult female bat. Phylogenetic analysis of the almost complete virus 
      genome revealed a close relationship with Finnish and Danish strains. This was
      the first finding of a CoV in bats in Sweden, and bats may play a role in the
      transmission cycle of CoVs in Sweden. Focused and targeted surveillance of CoVs
      in bats is warranted, with consideration of potential conflicts between public
      health and nature conservation required as many bat species in Europe are
      threatened and protected.

TI  - A Palmitic Acid-Conjugated, Peptide-Based pan-CoV Fusion Inhibitor Potently
      Inhibits Infection of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Other Variants of Concern.
LID - 549 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14030549 [doi]
AB  - Our previous studies have shown that cholesterol-conjugated, peptide-based
      pan-coronavirus (CoV) fusion inhibitors can potently inhibit human CoV infection.
      However, only palmitic acid (C16)-based lipopeptide drugs have been tested
      clinically, suggesting that the development of C16-based lipopeptide drugs is
      feasible. Here, we designed and synthesized a C16-modified pan-CoV fusion
      inhibitor, EK1-C16, and found that it potently inhibited infection by SARS-CoV-2 
      and its variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron, and other human CoVs and
      bat SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs). These results suggest that EK1-C16 could be
      further developed for clinical use to prevent and treat infection by the
      currently circulating MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and its VOCs, as well as any future
      emerging or re-emerging coronaviruses.

TI  - Bio-Based Solutions for Agriculture: Foliar Application of Wood Distillate Alone 
      and in Combination with Other Plant-Derived Corroborants Results in Different
      Effects on Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa L.).
LID - 404 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11030404 [doi]
AB  - Bio-stimulants are showing growing success and are gradually replacing synthetic 
      fertilizers in agriculture. Wood distillate (WD), also known as wood vinegar or
      pyroligneous acid, is a by-product of biomass pyrolysis and is increasingly used 
      as a bio-stimulant for crop production. This study investigated whether weekly
      foliar applications of 0.25% and 0.50% WD have a differential effect on the
      chlorophyll and sugar content as well as biomass production in lettuce (Lactuca
      sativa L.). Moreover, the additional beneficial effect from the addition of
      corroborants of plant origin such as 3% soy lecithin and 5% flavonoid-rich wood
      glycolic extract to WD (BF) was investigated. Moreover, the possible
      toxicological concern from some potentially toxic elements (PTEs), namely Cd, Cu,
      Fe, Pb, and Zn, which may be abundant in WD was verified. After four weeks, we
      found that 0.25% WD not only increases lettuce biomass, which has an economic
      value, but also has beneficial effects on other qualitative parameters such as
      sugars and total sweetness. On the other hand, the use of 0.5% WD decreased the
      content of soluble sugars, suggesting a hormetic-type effect. We did not find
      evidence of further beneficial effects from the addition to WD of plant-derived
      corroborants, nor of any enrichment in the content of the investigated PTEs.

TI  - Interaction of the Fungal Metabolite Harzianic Acid with Rare-Earth Cations
      (La(3+), Nd(3+), Sm(3+), Gd(3+)).
LID - 1959 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27061959 [doi]
AB  - Rare-earth elements are emerging contaminants of soil and water bodies which
      destiny in the environment and effects on organisms is modulated by their
      interactions with natural ligands produced by bacteria, fungi and plants. Within 
      this framework, coordination by harzianic acid (H2L), a Trichoderma secondary
      metabolite, of a selection of tripositive rare-earth cations Ln(3+) (Ln(3+) =
      La(3+), Nd(3+), Sm(3+,) and Gd(3+)) was investigated at 25 degrees C, and in a
      CH3OH/0.1 M NaClO4 (50/50 w/w) solvent, using mass spectrometry, circular
      dichroism, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and pH measurements. Experimental data can
      be satisfactorily explained by assuming, for all investigated cations, the
      formation of a mono-complex (LnL(+)) and a bis-complex (LnL2(-)). Differences
      were found between the formation constants of complexes of different Ln(3+)
      cations, which can be correlated with ionic radius. Since gadolinium is the
      element that raises the most concern among lanthanide elements, its effects on
      organisms at different levels of biological organization were explored, in the
      presence and absence of harzianic acid. Results of ecotoxicological tests suggest
      that harzianic acid can decrease gadolinium biotoxicity, presumably because of
      complex formation with Gd(3+).

TI  - Gene losses in the common vampire bat illuminate molecular adaptations to blood
      feeding.
PG  - eabm6494
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abm6494 [doi]
AB  - Vampire bats are the only mammals that feed exclusively on blood. To uncover
      genomic changes associated with this dietary adaptation, we generated a
      haplotype-resolved genome of the common vampire bat and screened 27 bat species
      for genes that were specifically lost in the vampire bat lineage. We found
      previously unknown gene losses that relate to reduced insulin secretion (FFAR1
      and SLC30A8), limited glycogen stores (PPP1R3E), and a unique gastric physiology 
      (CTSE). Other gene losses likely reflect the biased nutrient composition (ERN2
      and CTRL) and distinct pathogen diversity of blood (RNASE7) and predict the
      complete lack of cone-based vision in these strictly nocturnal bats (PDE6H and
      PDE6C). Notably, REP15 loss likely helped vampire bats adapt to high dietary iron
      levels by enhancing iron excretion, and the loss of CYP39A1 could have
      contributed to their exceptional cognitive abilities. These findings enhance our 
      understanding of vampire bat biology and the genomic underpinnings of adaptations
      to blood feeding.
