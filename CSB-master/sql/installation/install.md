# Installing `sqlite3` 

## All platforms

While probably the program is already installed on your computer, you might not have access to all its functions. You can install it from the official [download page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html). For Windows, install the bundle containing both the software, and the command-line tools for managing databases.
