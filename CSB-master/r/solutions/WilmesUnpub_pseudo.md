## Hints and pseudo code for Exercise 8.23.3 (Wilmes, unpublished)

1. Write a `for` loop that processes all images using the function `getArea` that is provided in `CSB/r/solutions/getArea.R`. The function accepts a single file name as argument, and returns the projected leaf area, measured in pixels. Your loop should record the leaf area for each image, and store it in the data frame `results`. To loop over all files, you can use the function `list.files` along with its pattern matching option, to produce a list of all the files with extension `.JPG` in the directory `CSB/r/data/leafarea/`. Work in your `sandbox` or change paths in the `getArea.R` function accordingly.

2. Plot the area of each plant as measured on time point 1 versus time point 2.

3. Determine if the plants significantly differ at time point 1 and 2 using a paired t-test.


**Hints**: 

- you will need to install the EBImage package and load it. You can use the code:

```r
# install the EBImage package: run the following two commands
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("EBImage")
# note that to install EBImage, you might need to install other libraries


# now load the library
library(EBImage)
```

- create an empty `data.frame` to record results

```r
results <- data.frame(JPG = character(), area = numeric(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

- the function `list.files` can be used to list all the files in a directory

- write a `for` loop and call the `getArea` function for each file; store the area in the data frame.

- to extract the information on time point and plant name, parse the file name

- to run a t-test in `R`, simply call `t.test`
